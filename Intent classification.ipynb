it dries to look nearly exactly how it looks in the bottle.\\n    - and believe me i tried - i bought them a canvas one, a kong one, an oversized plastic frisbee, even a $24 stuffed one with squeakies in it that looked a lot like the dogcatcher, but they turned their noses up at all of these.\\n    -

for daily use, i now go with simply right super absorbent 23x36 under pads from sams club which is also a very good product, not bad at keeping odor at bay, the size fits replacement crate trays, more room for 2 pups to use and best of all the cheap price tag of $24 for 120 pads and they are sold in-store, no need to order online.\\n    - when using one should wet the hair, apply a small amount to the palm of your hand i use a dime-nickle sized amount, rub your hands together and then apply to your hair and lather it for 1 minute.\\n    -

perfect size for a puppy or small dog.\\n    - right size, catches any fluid spilt on it and easy to clean up any mess thats get on it.\\n    - the only problem which im not sure if its even avoidable due to the packaging is that i had to tie it in place otherwise it collapses but it isnt problem enough to knock any stars.\\n    - it fits anyone under 30. the bottle is really cute too.\\n    - maybe high-end department stores have some trial sizes, etc.\\n    - lol start a marble size and work your way up over a couple weeks up to a blob a half the size of a golf ball.\\n    -

love this perfume was surprise by the bottle size, larger than i expected love this perfume.\\n    - they are made very well , but i cannot use them becsuse the size is a 2. it wasnt specified when i ordered the boots.so , if your fig is s size two.\\n    - by the way these are the larger ones - recommend them over the smaller ones two sizes.\\n    - so unless your a lady with a size 11 shoe or something, you should be ok.i notice though, that little bitty feet will not work with these, they would be too big if your feet are tiny.my shoe size is about a 9. i would think between size 7 and 10 would be good for these slippers.\\n    - my german shepherd/pyrenese mix loves it and its the perfect size for her\\n    - but, for a few pets this bottle is perfect.the only negative thing i can think of is the spring/harness/hanger that comes with the bottle.\\n    - the next one i opened, the safety seal was broken and the inside of the bottle was orange vs. white.\\n    - when the package came in the mail, the bottle was completely red.\\n    - $30+ for one 60ct bottle ?\\n    - other than the size of the seat, this rollator has all the nessesary features   adjustable handles, brakes that lock, 6 wheels, removable backrest and a tote bag for storage.\\n    - i greatly prefer it over standard gel  and the 1.7oz size is perfect for traveling with it in a carry-on bag.\\n    - theyre super light-weight and the perfect size for spices, nuts, seeds, powders, or small amounts of liquids.\\n    - i bought this in the largest size for my lab but my other three dogs keep getting on it including my yorkie.\\n    - im almost through the 180-capsule bottle and one thing i have noticed is i feel more alert and dont seem to hit that 3 00 slump anymore.\\n    - i took my bottle of young living lavender and comapared it to the one in this set, and my nose could not tell a difference.\\n    - i use the bigger one in the downstairs or kitty bathroom for their over-sized litter box, and the smaller paw-print mat beneath their food and water bowls in the kitchen.\\n    - perfect for a medium sized mustache this is great for my medium sized mustache.\\n    - chap stick size fyi im not sure what i was thinking.\\n    - good buy and reveals brighter skin works great but use per the directions on the bottle and be prepared for your skin to look a little flaky and dry for the first few days.\\n    - i didnt want a return for my money or anything, i just wanted to let them know to prevent future instances like mine from happening and they company actually sent me a whole bottle at no cost.\\n    - i bought another slightly cheaper and popular brand about four times here but found inconsistencies in the quality of enteric-coating from one bottle to the next.\\n    - i think its a very mild type of glue but i cant be sure exactly what that sticky stuff is that holds down the flap on the back of the package.overall, you just cant ask for better quality tissues when youre on the go and cant carry a large size box with you!\\n    - they are small enough about the size of a dime to give out frequently without worrying about added calories.\\n    - he has already ordered another bottle.\\n    - it keeps the scent until the bottle is empty!\\n    - 5 for quality, 1 for deceptive packaging.\\n    - that puts her at the top of the range for size 4 in both categories and at the bottom of the range for size 5 for both girth and weight.\\n    - my bigger concern is the packaging though.\\n    - it has great glide, a little goes a long way, and i love not having to deal with loud and annoying pump lotion bottles.\\n    - the box specifies using alcohol presumably rubbing alcohol to disinfect the skin where the derma roller is used and the micro needles of the roller itself, so that is why so much attention is given to the packaging of this product and to providing the clear hard plastic box.\\n    - i went to kmart way back when and bought up every bottle of the old formula citrus they had.\\n    - i just refill the spray bottles from the big jug.i generally warm a disposable wipe from the tap, squeeze it out then spritz it with about 3 squirts of the perineal cleanser.\\n    - they should send out one cap in each size for free so that you can see whats actually going to fit before you buy it and pay shipping for something thats not going to fit.\\n    - i liked this item coming out of the box, it was well-labeled, each pill box just the right size for all my pills.\\n    - my neighbors labrador is average size for her breed, and she fits just fine on it.\\n    - another plus is that it is quite water proof which is a relief since it rains a lot where we live, so the vest wont be soaked when you come home from a rainy day, and neither will be your dog.the service dog patches seem quite good quality and are easily removable and quite visible, they are about 3/4x2 3/4 which unfortunately i didnt know before purchasing, so i bought a wrong sized patch i wanted to use an emotional support dog patch.\\n    - i dampened my hair with a water spray bottle and some moisturizer and thats it.\\n    - i like the non-jittery effect and the handy packaging.\\n    - i am so disappointed in purchasing this product because it worked fine the first week or two but now i have to find a more eco-friendly product that work do this over time.\\n    - i wanted to show off the relative sizes and provide as best as a video can do a comparison of the noise made by the two models.\\n    - perfect size for my little shih tzu.\\n    - it is more painful to use that my more expensive derma rollers, but for 1/2 the cost you are getting what you pay for.<br /><br />the 0.5mm size is good for around eyes and smile lines.\\n    - perfect size & weight.\\n    - i have used my bottle for 2 years and just ordered again.the label and bottle is different, but same name.\\n    - perfect dog water bottle.\\n    - two stars bottle was broken when arrived!\\n    - great item, wrong size  .\\n    - probably an xxl would not fit most 20-lb dogs.i also bought a size xl, for my sisters 12-lb maltese, which fits him pretty well he wears a size small in zack & zoey.the colors are nice and bright.\\n    - the packaging comes in a resealable bag.\\n    - i ended up liking all four of them and am currently waiting for full sizes of the hot pink and gold to arrive.\\n    - very absorbent, large size and well made.\\n    - pleasant surprise when i ordered this, i was expecting only the 3.4 oz bottle.\\n    - this is used by my father at age 90. nothing happens, after using 2 bottles.\\n    - and really over priced for such a small bottle  \\n    - some people dont like that its called marketing i have a question for all you watchdogs does it seem reasonable to you that someone would write a positive review to get a free bottle of a product they really dont like?\\n    - everyone, be sure to inspect your bottles for serial numbers the one on box, usually stamped or written on the bottom should match with the one on the bottle itself.\\n    - these are about the size of a tennis ball, so slightly smaller than the other models of this brand carried at petsmart.\\n    - thankfully we had a old bottle we could use the top off if.\\n    - dogs measurement s were right between sizes and should have gone with the next larger size.\\n    - this bottle is fantastic!\\n    - i opened it and the plastic top on the bottle was coated inside with runny brown tanner, and it had leaked all down the bottle.\\n    - we purchased this crate medium size - listed as 27hx24wx36l from a different online retailer.\\n    - this is a packaging issue though and in no way detracts from the litter.\\n    - as long as you are aware of the size, this is a great purchase.\\n    - obviously one knows what to do with a face cream, but it’s always nice to have guidance on the packaging for a new product, like how much to use, etc.<br /><br />all in all i would recommend this product to people who are happy to pay for an effective and luxurious cream.\\n    - therefore, i buy it in the smaller bottles only.\\n    - great flavor and size.\\n    - because you add a layer daily, it gets thick in the bottle very fast.\\n    - i even bought a second bottle for my boyfriend because he shaves his head completely bald and gets razor burn bad on the back of his neck and it worked the same for him as it did me and now we dont shave without it.\\n    - i did get a free bottle to try.\\n    - the packaging is rather ingeniously designed to slip right onto a towel rack.\\n    - you will have more kit for less weight, size and money.\\n    - just make sure to buy it from here because elsewhere the bottle runs 40-50 bucks.\\n    - i figured i would give it a shot and ordered a couple of bottles of dermanail.\\n    - size is about 17.5 in x 29.5 in\\n    - great for nail designs, the doting sizes are not to different from each other but once you get a hold of the am mount of nail polish you need for each size you will be able to see more difference.\\n    - love this conditioner, on my 2nd bottle my sister gave this to me for christmas.\\n    - poor packaging.\\n    - five stars perfect size for traveling\\n    - i see this product isnt available today which gives me a good reason to see how well a bottle of generic milk of magnesia would work in lieu of this product.\\n    - nice batteries and easy open packaging.\\n    - kleenex scores a goal with this pocket sized pack of 15 two ply facial tissues.\\n    - works great but i needed a bigger bottle and nozzle.\\n    - i assure you that this is completely real the packaging was tightly sealed and the offical box was there too.\\n    - this size is best for really small dogs, but it worked well for us and does not take up much space.\\n    - cuts my medium sized dogs nails with ease.\\n    - same price as before, half the size this is my second time ordering this particular soap, although ive ordered other scents from this brand in the past.\\n    - again, i only used about a dime size so the smell was not too strong.\\n    - dont buy the 3 bottle kit.\\n    - sometimes i have to cut it down to fit my junior-sized shirts which is a little annoying.\\n    - i have a 20lb ragdoll who stays on this everyday.perfect size for him and his brother it is very sturdy.\\n    - capsules were broken inside the bottle when i opened it!\\n    - you do not feel jittery at all and it does give you energy throughout the day and thank you to gloria for sending me a free bottle and your feedback!\\n    - i like the size of the soft gels and its easy .\\n    - its size was bigger than i expected.\\n    - was looking for the same thing that was used in the hospital for help with keeping the baby from making a mess.this was the right size as i need for my changing pad for my little one.i have had many pees and poops on them and they keep it all in and nothing goes out very absorbent!highly recommend for that purpose and any other purpose needed for keeping some messes in.\\n    - perfect size.\\n    - new bag design very hard to unroll and pull apart, size and shape are very small, quality of bags is very poor.\\n    - my hair is shoulder length and i use a little less than a quarter size from the roots to the tips and just shake out the curl.\\n    - i would not accept a bottle of it now if you paid me to take it.\\n    - product good, packaging is meh this product is really good.\\n    - just finished the whole bottle.\\n    - the size was perfect and fit exactly into the wooden hutch i have for them.\\n    - they only made 3000 bottles and most were filled with tiny beads and used as mile markers on the mongolian steppe.\\n    - i bought these after reading the reviews that said they did not leak like other bottles.\\n    - with this bottle you attach the holder and then can adjust the bottle to the needed height.\\n    - i had trouble finding the right size for my expensive stainless steel kitchen 10 gallon garbage can.\\n    - size small fits our 14 lb puppy with room to grow.\\n    - good size.\\n    - in order to make this a fair trial i decided when my bottles were empty i would wait a few weeks to see what happens.\\n    - it is a lot bigger than it appears, if you know what the size of a mouth harp is - thats about the size.\\n    - came on time, no complaints about the packaging.\\n    - i was really disappointed with the size.\\n    - i bought this as a stocking stuffer but will buy a few more as im sure i will misplace it like i do everything else this size.\\n    - it works great, the tote actually helps to insulate the bottle so the water stays cold longer.\\n    - im disappointed with it tho for one <br />-the product had busted and it was all over the inside of the box<br />-looks like they tried to tape it or something but it was just bad packaging on their part.<br />-there wasnt much in there to begin with even my mother noticed.<br />-she has really damaged hair from dyes over the years shes tried everything this just wasnt it.\\n    - i bought this bottle for a song, as part of the add-on program on amazon.\\n    - i purchased a bottle already and noticed a vast difference in my hair, it was healthier, stronger and shinier.\\n    - it doesnt fit a full size truck seat.\\n    - all the better for us because we go through the bottle slower.\\n    - the newer bottle specifies **probiotic 30 billion cfus is stable while refrigerated or stored at room temperature ~70°f.\\n    - the results have been so incredible that i bought a second bottle for my mom.would absolutely recommend, five gold stars!\\n    - im confident the bed will still be big enough for him once hes reached his full adult size.\\n    - love it, but know what your buying i personally love the smell of the anarchy, i think its axes best deodorant but there are 2 types by the same name so after calling axe and having it explained to me, here is the difference<br />one is blue in color and smells a little lighter, and does not say antiperspirant<br />the other is white &34;my favorite&34; and say antiperspirant & smells stronger in my opinion<br />both types are anarchy<br />by the way, if you have the time call the customer service number on the bottle and have them explain it or any other questions, they will send a free coupon for a free product up to a $6 dollar value, i used my right away!\\n    - two nice size zippered pockets for info and/or doggie-bags.\\n    - pkg is what u get size is small and shower proof\\n    - unlike other diet pills i dont feel over caffeinated, shaky, etc, but my cravings & portion sizes decreased a lot and my energy levels were better.\\n    - once synced to the computer a process which is easy, and automatic once set up, you can view how many steps, and how many calories youve burned for specific periods of the day, in 15 minute increments.in this case, size really does matter.\\n    - also i plan to buy another bottle.\\n    - works good, not happy with size of rollers these work really well but there are too many different sizes and not that many of each type.\\n    - for my size 13 feet this unit is not large .\\n    - however, the only time i will need it to roll is when i move it to retrieve other pet items behind it, which isnt a major ordeal.all in all, i would recommend this container because of the size, added bonuses, color, and overall price.\\n    - runs small im usually a size medium top and i ordered a large so it would be loose but when it came i could barely even put it on.\\n    - the size small fit my 45 pound dog perfect.\\n    - this product is a yellowish gel, that has a sickly-sweet melon and cucumber scent, and the back of the bottle is all in arabic.\\n    - the size is perfect for a medium sized cat.\\n    - i will continue another month with my free bottle they will give me.\\n    - i have lost a whole dress size and working on the next.\\n    - we also can not have her sleep in these at night as they are prone to leak if shes in them for over 6 hours - a problem that has been alleviated by placing her in huggies pure & natural size 2 at night.\\n    - the cat is medium size and a stray.i would have returned it but i got sick and i think i’m past the date of returning.i made my own feeding station with a large clear tote turned on its side against the wind and held down by bricks i happened to have.it seems sturdy enough.\\n    - my other water bottles worked fine.\\n    - just look at this prices for the size of the bottle.\\n    - i do not notice the formula being any different from when it was in the old packaging.\\n    - i am only giving it 4 stars because i wish that it came in a bigger size so it lasted longer.\\n    - it trims them down to two different sizes with the two included comb attachments and is also good for trimming any stray hairs around the eyebrows.\\n    - perfect size for travel and waterproof.\\n    - the key is only use a small dime size amount.\\n    - my mask love the mask and love that it is not messy at all , gos on my face fine and washed off easy also pretty good size and amount in the bottle\\n    - anyways, its the perfect size for 4 rats maximum.\\n    - will also mention that the product seemed exceptionally packaged in its original packaging.\\n    - the supplements included instructions on how to get a free bottle of the same product.\\n    - good size bites for his small mouth.\\n    - the large holds three medium-sized adult females with room to spare.\\n    - it is a good size for 3 cats and not require a lot of attention.\\n    - good size for my pomeranian.\\n    - sizes which are sufficient to allow noticeable results from use.\\n    - however, it does not shrink the size of my pimple , but will slightly reduce the redness and help remove left over dirt.<br /><br />overall its a 4/5 for softness and face texture after use.\\n    - the packaging for each condom is very reassuring.\\n    - the first time i used it, i used only a quarter-sized amount of the shampoo twice, and i still had my dandruff.\\n    - im crediting the cages size with the reduced seeds on the floor.\\n    - perfect for dressy occasion just the right size.\\n    - i used an entire bottle on a roughly 3 circumference stain.\\n    - ive tried using each product separately with other brands but it doesnt give me the same feeling gonna buy the fullsize shampoo & conditioner now!\\n    - i still try to run at the coolest time possible but on the weekends on long runs its nice to not have to get up at 4am.you do still have to pay attention to your dog and keep the jacket wet if youre out for a while but bringing an extra chilled bottle of water while out is a small price to pay to have a very happy pup.on a side note i see a few posts on here about people worried about their little buddys paws.\\n    - i dont know if i received a defunct bottle or what, but i wont be ordering from this company again.\\n    - my fiance was pleased i had a doubt that the perfume is a counterfeit product because i have seen a lot of perfumes which are bottled and packed exactly the same but are fake.\\n    - i put this on my head when i feel a migraine about to rear its ugly head, and this icy cold magic in a bottle can take a 9 to a 5 on a pain scale.\\n    - i use a 16 or more ounce bottle.\\n    - she’s always trying to find nice natural creams that she can wear during the day under her makeup and many are either too greasy or makeup curdles with it.<br /><br />i like the simple and elegant packaging.\\n    - im not a fan of that.<br /><br />the packaging also leaves something to be desired.\\n    - it is great for high heat situations and equally as good ride on the bottle, as lucille ball would say its tasty too as in vetivitiveggimin.\\n    - the compact size is ingenious while still giving consumers 15 white two ply tissues to use so theyre never without a tissue if they need to clean anything or blow their nose.the first time i showed this pocket pack to a friend of mine she thought it was some sort of joke because she couldnt figure out how to open it!\\n    - the bottle of product just 20-30% full  disappointed about saller who was taking care of this package\\n    - very colorful decoration, nice size.\\n    - they fit my toddler really well and the size 4 diapers have never leaked on us.\\n    - because i sleep with my hands by my face, this puts me into dream land very quickly.i had difficulty getting the oil out of the bottle, but the solution to that is that the top will come off with a knife, run hot water over the top, and pop it back on.this essential oil blend is 90% jojoba and 10% chamomile oil, but it is still very strong and works well.on another note, i had a problem with this company and this specific purchase, and the company fixed it and made it right.\\n    - for the price you cant beat the coverage size, and our pup has taken to it without incident.\\n    - after he died, i found out that no water came out of the bottle after one or two drinks.\\n    - plus they send you a free bottle after you receive your first bottle.\\n    - i inhale directly from the bottle the aroma of this frankincense.\\n    - my only complaint is that they are actually business card size, which is really too small for all the information contained.\\n    - i finally bought the big bottle at target 9 bucks and within a week of using it day and night my skin is actually an even tone.\\n    - im halfway thru the bottle & ive not lost anything, im hopeful its gonna kick in soon.\\n    - we selected that size based on estimated adult size of our new puppy.\\n    - not only will you learn how to use it properly, and find you could have been using far less, but its also quite entertaining.i bought my first bottle probably 30-something years ago.\\n    - of course it depends on the size of the dog you are walking.\\n    - it just promises to make it appear thicker/fuller-- which it absolutely does!<br /><br />pro <br />the smell is nice and mild, imo.<br />makes hair soft and silky<br />when hair dries you can noticibly see that it appears to be fuller and thicker<br />bottles look small but  last long<br /><br />con <br />makes my hair a bit frizzy i guess thats from the volume that its adding or a side effect of sorts from the fulling effect?<br /> i would definitely recommed this product as well as the conditioner.<br /><br />**fyi** - buy at walmart for under $6!<br />just thought i should mention, i bought the keratin oil pink bottle shampoo and conditioner as well because i noticed my hair was breaking when i combed it.\\n    - these stickers were great for a nice look without a lot of work.<br />they stick well and i like having the different sizes.\\n    - 1. adjust smaller serving sizes using the pillow technique found in another review - worked well!\\n    - ordering another bottle.\\n    - though the previous reviewer said the collar was too large, i believe she simply ordered the smallest size without looking at the description or measuring her dogs neck-- the collar is actually much smaller than the amazon description states.size  w-2.0 cm x l-35 cm extends till 45 cm.this means that the collar should be over 17 inches which is admittedly huge for a small collar.the collar i received has a maximum extended length of 35cm, and barely fits my border collie mix who wears a 14.5 collar.im very frustrated by the sizing problems, but the collar works and appears to be fairly well made.\\n    - i like the size and the feel of the silicone is great, but it leaks and i had to use waterline tape plumbers know what i mean to stop the leak.\\n    - not sized.\\n    - it says to dilute it with water but i just apply it directly from the bottle.\\n    - just the right size to carry on a walk for that needed water break thats all i have to say but they wont take my review un less its over 20 words long but theyre asking for my feedback\\n    - it is conveniently labeled on the back of the bottle so that when you see it in the store, you feel like you are buying more.\\n    - so this was a great size for her.\\n    - my only complaint is the bottle- wide and flat and guaranteed to fall over for no good reason.\\n    - good product, and i will be receiving my free bottle.\\n    - i cannot belief these sizes.\\n    - however after playing with the bottle for a while i decided to stab it with a pen.\\n    - another feature is you are cleaning both sides of the lens at the same time, and area these cover is perfect for a lens of any size.\\n    - trying a new supplement company and after reading the ingredients in these blends orders were placed for several different trial sizes.\\n    - these patches/dots come in 2 sizes, which is nice, but they are much thicker and do not blend in with the surface of your skin, so you cant blend in the patch with makeup to make it less visible.\\n    - on this specific jumbo size, it works well.\\n    - im glad i bought the trial size because the two products arent worth the money.\\n    - great product but should of got a size smaller.\\n    - this spray does not have anything questionable--just some juices and natural flavors, along with stevia to make it tasty.you can take this bottle with you wherever you go, as long as you keep it cool and dry, so it does not lose its potency.\\n    - i am currently taking my first bottle of alli and thought i would give some helpful tips to new customers.\\n    - great with reservation the jars are a great size, and being see thru is awesome.\\n    - it was so strong, i was a little worried that the bottle may have broken during transport.\\n    - she loves the size.\\n    - i am not throwing in the towel yet on this product--im guessing a bottle will last a few months--so will try the entire bottle---i am optimistic that ill see improvement in my fine eye wrinkles, as the oz hyaluronic serum is working already.\\n    - my only complaint is that the sizes are inconsistent.\\n    - i use only the two largest size rollers for my particular hairstyle.\\n    - its literally the only way to increase the size of your penis.\\n    - the size is perfect.\\n    - used a whole bottle regularly over course of about 2 months - no noticeable change.\\n    - disappointed seems that the perfume lost his scent after a week in the bottle.\\n    - she wears us size m but xl here fits perfect for her.\\n    - every attempt to roto-rooter out the pin sized drain hole has failed and even super glue has not adhered the razor holder back in place because it is too smooth and is always wet.\\n    - i thought it was neat that it also came with a divider so that if you know your puppy will grow you can get this kennel now and make the space for the puppy smaller until it reaches full size.\\n    - the gate was the perfect size for a nine pound puppy.\\n    - wish there was a curved clip for the bangs in a smaller size too.\\n    - while i would be okay with shrinking maybe half a size in clothes, im not at all overweight 59 size 8, i dont do diets, make bad food choices etc.\\n    - its pretty small tho, like between a penny and dime size.\\n    - good product, but unless you have a size 92 .\\n    - great quality fabric great quality fabric, but the bust size is very small.\\n    - got home and checked my old bottle and saw that the newer versions first ingredient is now water - would have liked a mention of a different formula.\\n    - its the perfect size for a small child or someone who doesnt carry much in their purse.\\n    - i have bought a bottle for myself to see if it will help me with the pain in my knees beginning arthritis and my baldness it runs in the family.\\n    - the razors were already opened and it looks like the packaging on one of the razor blades was opened as well .\\n    - if you consider buying, buy at least one size up because the fit is tight.\\n    - [[asin b000gfi7uy angels eyes tear-stain eliminator for dogs, 30 gram bottle]][[asin b000uzgba8 angels eyes tear-stain eliminator for dogs, 240 gram bottle]]\\n    - great for the skin, a bit too aromatic ive read that barage oil is one of the best oils for facial skin and i was really excited about trying it, but as soon as i opened the bottle i found it the aroma of this particular oil to be too strong for me.\\n    - its like they realized that people are purchasing it for the hope that it will help as an anti-angiogenic medication for cancer treatment and now feel as if they can shaft everyone.the price has gone up $40/bottle over the course of 3 months.\\n    - however, the size of the opening cut into the actual door for the classic model i have is larger than the one required for the new model for the large sized flap.\\n    - my 11-year old female golden retriever loves bottles.\\n    - pretty color & packaging, but i need a longer lasting lipstick.\\n    - the next time i used the shampoo, i used more than half a dollar-sized amount, nothing.\\n    - in other words, the packaging was not as pictured.\\n    - these are a perfect size for my cats.\\n    - i would prefer to have less variety of sizes and more a particular size.\\n    - i came back to amazon to purchase four more bottles.\\n    - i reordered the same color and bottle the  first bottle of tressa was great!\\n    - i since have ordered several bottles and shared some of them for friends and family members and they all had similar results.\\n    - she requested that i open the other bottles.\\n    - hard to get down.big bottle with not very long a shelf life.so if you dont take it everyday as posted you end up wasting a lot.\\n    - i was actually able to shed off at least two sizes in a fairly short period of time with the help of fenfast.\\n    - pitbull mix, and she played with a medium size toy.cannot recommend it - it is a dangerous toy.\\n    - good for a small to medium size room.\\n    - seems like good quality but possible sized wrong?.\\n    - my wife particularly insensitive to vitamin size and these measure three-quarter inches long by a quarter-inch wide a quarter-inch high, thats a pretty small size for a multivitamin.\\n    - i never seem to get the right size or thickness .\\n    - and i opened all the other bottles to make sure it wasnt a fluke think with just one of them.\\n    - went through a whole bottle.\\n    - too much packaging, amazon.\\n    - ive had experience with pet naturals dry hip & joint tablets like this  [[asin b0015quuda pet naturals hip & joint tablets, extra strength, 120-count bottle]] which did a miraculous job healing a collapsing trachea for our elderly pomeranian, and thought id give these a try and see if it could help our new girl feel a little better.to my amazement, after just about 3 weeks of 2 of these a day, shes feeling like a puppy.\\n    - there isnt room for a typical-sized water bottle, but i have a smallish 12 ounce water container that fits in just fine.\\n    - insert the brush all the way into the bottle and remove excess as you pull it out.\\n    - love it but it was very damaged i was very excited to receive this item, loved it, the style, size, it was great!!\\n    - bottle lasts me about a month, which isnt a bad investment at all.\\n    - i want my aki to be healthy and happy again.i let him smell the bottle and the contents inside phew, stinky to me!\\n    - even at the larger size, i thought it was pricey soap but still ordered it.\\n    - the size is just about right not too big and not too small.\\n    - bought this small bottle for my travel bag, as i dont ever want to be without it!\\n    - these have never leaked for me.prosquietwide top for easy cleaning and adding icepsycho bunny proofcan be mounted outside the cagedoes not leakeasy to fillheight is easy to adjustconsits plasticwould be difficult to install in a glass tankthe plastic holder could be sturdier, it might break if bottle is forced into it\\n    - pros  the size is perfect for our narrow tub, the feet easily adjust, has a lower rack for soaps and shampoos if needed, seems quite sturdy.cons  the seat doesnt twist as easily as id like it to.\\n    - the watchis too bulky in the middle to be worn comfortably at night.i would also like to say that fitibits customer service has been horrible with trying to address some of my concerns.i had planned on giving them the benefit of the doubt and seeing if the xl size would alleviate some of theproblems with hr acquisition, but the xl is on some horribly long back order.\\n    - the entire unit is also a nice size.\\n    - nice stuff, obnoxious bottle this is a great, refreshing, nondrying shower gel and it immediately became a favorite.\\n    - the shade looks so much darker in the bottle, but is really just shimmery, almost shear.\\n    - scotch tape over the lid is a quick fix though, and many of the more expensive hamster balls look identical to this one, so i dont think that they are necessarily more secure.other than that, its a good size for dwarf hamsters and maybe small mice?\\n    - i am very upset that i spent $40 on a bottle of lotion that will just get tossed away.\\n    - good size for my green cheeked conure\\n    - this bed fits her okay, but i would recommend one size up for a dog that size.the material is a nice tough, durable material.\\n    - i ordered a bottle for my friend who was having similar problems.\\n    - no mg shown here phentramine after goggling this product i read the bottle said it was hoodia and caffeine only.\\n    - ive had several different sizes of these sheets for several months.\\n    - five stars tiny bottles 2 grams but still a fabulous product for a fabulous price!\\n    - i didnt love the fact that it had leaked all over the inside of the packaging.\\n    - with a little bit of hairspray curls come out perfect with all the barrel sizes.\\n    - it really fits full sized cats and has a place for water and food also very open a nice carrier for my kitten.\\n    - also, the packaging was a bit concerning at first.\\n    - i received a refill bottle with no box and no pump, just plastic wrap.\\n    - my cat wont use traditional sized hooded litter boxes.\\n    - the only negative is the glass bottle plastic is better for travel and for those of us that have tile flooring.\\n    - size, i checked out amazon.\\n    - its very good at curbing your appetitei know there are some bad reviews about this product and im sorry it didnt work for those people but ive gone from a size 12 to a size 8 in one month without exercising.\\n    - they are not dwarfs and i did not want to purchase the dwarf size habitrail, knowing they would grow.\\n    - if i eat just one, it isnt as bad, but when i eat 2 i definitely need a bottle of water.\\n    - unfortunately, this is one that chips pretty easily but for the size it is worth it, just gotta watch her while she chews!\\n    - the vest is lightweight, and sturdy, and seems to sit quite comfortably on my tiny cocker spaniel.i was a bit thrown off by the many customer reviews that claimed that the vest was too small, so i purchased a size m 21 - 27, for my 20lb cocker who is exactly 22 chest girth.\\n    - one bottle lasts me a year.\\n    - i think they need to redo the one size fits all and make one with small elastic bands.\\n    - lots of different screw sizes within for the various components of a set of glasses.\\n    - terrible smell from plastic packaging!.\\n    - i take it for a rather complicated medical-condition, and from the blood-work done before and after taking it after about two weeks, it does appear to be something that has made a marvelous improvement, but when taken in large doses, care must be given because it does seem to have the detriment of affecting blood-clotting, and when taken in very large doses, seem to be counter-productive.i am very satisfied with everything about this product, from the very reasonable price to the standardized polysaccaride-content, to the capsule size, itself.thank you, now foods, for marketing this product for those of us whom really need it.lindsey\\n    - i part my hair in the middle after a  shower and then apply about a nickle size to each side.\\n    - does the job, but a part was cracked when i got it and it only comes with one attachment for hose sizes.\\n    - i can also fit a good sized blanket in it for him.\\n    - i expected it to be an average size but it is very large.\\n    - after opening the 1st bottle, my husband and i could smell the krill oil.\\n    - the packaging is nice, the spray volume more than adequate, and the product goes on easily and well.<br /><br />my only quibble with the product is the smell.\\n    - i love these liter sizes, because they last months even for long hair and are a better value than the regular bottle sizes.\\n    - everyone has different effects to different powders so i would say try a sample size or something close to it and compare versus your old powder.\\n    - i think it was effective at low strength; that is, if the bottle says &34;use for 5-10 baths,&34; id use 10% of the bottle each time.\\n    - if you liked self absorbed, then the equivalent replacement would be urban antidotes recovery blue bottle.\\n    - i buy my products iin gift sets from salons since its cheaper and a im a student .. but i have had the same bottle for six months and im not even half way through it ..i only flat iron my hair once a week  its well worth a try and money.\\n    - i have used it with several different sized irons and it works well with most.<br /><br />the one small minus is that it barely fits the 2 curling iron that i use most often.\\n    - on my 2nd bottle, very happy with the results.\\n    - and this is a great price for one bottle.\\n    - i have an amstaff pitbull and the 42 x 26 size fits her perfect.\\n    - i ordered these, like im sure most people do, because of the specific size of the condom.\\n    - you can vary the size of the dot by changing the amount of pressure you apply with even the biggest tool.\\n    - great shampoo pump this works perfectly for the 33.8 oz shampoo bottle but would not fit the conditioner bottle.\\n    - i just wished it was a better way to open the bottles.\\n    - does not say you cannot return it on the order page anywhere.how is this a hazarodous material?this is something you can pour down the drain and recycle the bottle.for safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to amazon.com.\\n    - the bottle is empty and i did not even loose 1lb.\\n    - i purchased the small because that is the size my 7lb chihuahua usually wears well the shirt came tiny.\\n    - followed the instructions on the bottle, and within minutes after she consumed a portion of wet cat food with bm tone-up, she produced a liquid bowel movement the size of a dinner plate.\\n    - after 1 1/2 weeks of using this water bottle, my guinea pig died of dehydration.\\n    - i have a standard size bathtub with a showerdoor and this fit perfectly fine.\\n    - my bottle has veggie based cellulose capsules, with the national institute of health and others advising that studies bear out that veggie caps are the ideal medium for capsule use in freeze dried antibiotics.\\n    - two out of the 6 bottles the polish was thick and gummy and looked previously used!\\n    - i just wish they were standard size like eyeliner pencils.\\n    - i like the purple color better than the pink i ordered the pink originally but the sizes didnt fit.\\n    - even the best products are not for everyone, all the time.my bottle arrived as a sample for review.\\n    - for the size of these i wish they lasted longer.\\n    - my sister, whom received it as a stocking stuffer loved the color and its small size.\\n    - while i do not use the metal bottom or guard, i think both features work very well on a pan of this size unlike the smaller litter pans in which neither the guard nor the great are all that practical or effective.\\n    - going off the first bottle i had, that shampoo is good & smells great.\\n    - maybe they should make different sizes, not all seat are the same.\\n    - i feel that a placebo effect would explain the significant decrease in muscle soreness that i expected but would not explain the surprising post workout pump and growth which i did not expect at all.i know there are pricy packaged pre/post workout cocktails out there but i like measuring out the exact amounts of the materials i want that are appropriate to my size, diet, timing and regimen.\\n    - great size.\\n    - the bottle i purchased said it was great for legs, body, bikini area, etc.\\n    - thankfully i bought several large bottles of the old formula!\\n    - beds this size are not cheap and usually only last aprox 9 months before theyre worn out and need re-stuffing or to be tossed.\\n    - great packaging in a locking bucket easy to feed.\\n    - the perfect size for a challenge.\\n    - to small for a pocket comb nice looking, but much smaller than a standard size comb.\\n    - i also like the size, not too big and not too small.\\n    - very, very disappointed that about half of a bottle had liked into the plastic bag and out into the card board box.\\n    - its an awesome shirt a little smaller than what it says so i would go with size bigger especially if you plan on washing and drying it often i would probably go maybe two sizes bigger but its awesome shirt fits my pit just wish i would have just got a bigger size because i do wash and dry\\n    - [[videoid moshujkezsck12]]esmé loves this ball, but for her size 6 month old, 35lb collie puppy, she can become pretty destructive having this ball flying all over the house.\\n    - i love it this make palette comes in a small size fits perfect in your make up bag i recommended to any pretty girl like me\\n    - i had to take the cushion out and replace it with a blanket, though, because shes a little bigger than the size of dog this bed is intended for and she would always scrunch the cushion up going inside.\\n    - perfect for my medium sized cat and covers the liter .\\n    - the bar size is more compressed smaller in length and wider than those i previously received.\\n    - i ordered this size this time.\\n    - this is my first time trying a chemical peel.<br />i consider myself someone with a sensitive acne-prone skin however the instructions say not to use this on sensitive skin.<br />meaning i often have a burning/red/breakout reaction to cosmetics, even the well-known ones for sensitive skin.<br />av&egrave;ne, la roche-posay, louis widmer, etc..<br /><br />packaging<br />the bottle is packed in a bubble-wrap, then in a very sturdy little box.<br />a small card of skin beauty solutions, a plastic bag with gauze pads and instructions are also provided.<br />it was delivered to me, a location in europe, in 8 business days.<br /><br />effect<br />i first did a patch test on my neck.\\n    - the packaging is so elegant it feels like a priceless gem.\\n    - who really cares about a bottle they are going to throw away when empty?!?\\n    - from the picture i thought this would be a good pocket comb, but the size only about half a standard pocket comb makes it more of a mustache and beard comb.\\n    - the bottle itself has plastic raised rings that the holder slides between.\\n    - thanks for the great product and the free bottle for writing this review, i will order again\\n    - waited until i had used the entire bottle before writing this review and was expecting to be disappointed but was not.\\n    - the medium is a nice size for our six month old borador now, but i bet ill be ordering the large sometime soon!\\n    - i wanted it to groom maltese, but the blade sizes arent really what i need for a body trim i have found.\\n    - im giving it 5 stars for its ease of use, packaging and timely delivery.\\n    - not sure if it made his size any different, as he moved fast, so a+ on his part performing better.\\n    - i also love the fact that this tool can wave a good size amount of hair at one time.\\n    - my skin care regimen consists of a st. ives exfoliating scrub a couple times a week, wash with niapads every night, and niaserum as a moisturizer after i wash. this is a wonderful product, and i do not find it too sticky or have an undesirable texture.the spray bottle container was weird for me at first, but if you close your eyes and spritz a couple sprays on you will be fine and it wont run i think this is the best way to apply.\\n    - it took a couple of returns, but the small size in this jacket finally fits my 5.3 pound chihuahua perfectly!\\n    - they are the perfect size for him.\\n    - i just recently purchased this dogloo for my medium sized dog.\\n    - great product,  i love it the only bad thing is that a hair came in one of the glitter bottles but other than that it is awesome  \\n    - adjustable and true to size.\\n    - when it gets to a 1-1/2 inch size, i puff it in the microwave for about 1 minute to make it safe for her to finish.\\n    - use milk thistle for at least 2 weeks prior  to your starting day this helps balance your hormones and prepare for  the herbs youre about to start taking and take more than suggested dosage i used bustmaxx  and actually got it to work pretty fast by taking 3x what the bottle said.\\n    - hope in a bottle?\\n    - some reviewers said it wouldnt fit the big 40 oz bottle but it fits just fine.\\n    - the jel-lee material is very stretchy to accommodate your size, and the inner ribs feel very good.\\n    - each bottle that i have holds 1qt 1.8fl oz, that is 1 quart + 1.8 ounces or 1 liter.\\n    - the pad itself is about 24 long and 6-8 wide.quite large.the yellow pads are the same size, only thinner.hope this helps everyone.\\n    - my only problem with this is the packaging.\\n    - perhaps because of the smaller size, the dogs have been very hard on this, but it is one of their favorite toys, and they will try and steal it for one another on a regular basis.\\n    - perfect size for my chihuahua.\\n    - if it doesnt you are out a few dollars and no worse off-it is easily applied.-the dog does not chew up the bottle itselfcons -the other dog licks the first dog without hesitation leading me to believe the latter dog is broken or bitter spray just doesnt work on every animal.-it does not last indefinitely, we have to reapply whenever our dog is left alone or he starts chewing on himself immediately.-we have no way of knowing if it stings when coming in contact with scratches or irritations.\\n    - recommend using one bottle just for it though very hard to get it out of the bottle.\\n    - i thought that a perfume should live as long as you have some in your bottle.\\n    - they are a nice small size for smaller dogs.\\n    - they taste great and i find myself drinking more water during the day when i have a bottle in my pocket.\\n    - this is a massive bottles that lasts several months of daily washes.\\n    - improved acne i got a small bottle of this as a trial from bare minerals.\\n    - this is pretty bold, i cant believe the person who tampered with this would think that no one would notice this as there are rubber bits hanging off the bottom of the bottle.\\n    - im afraid that if i had gotten the next size larger though, it would have been baggy on her and she would have gotten a foot caught in it or something.\\n    - this bottle is fantastic!\\n    - before i finished one bottle, others could even notice a reduction of fine lines!\\n    - im going to cut the dosage in half and finish the bottle.\\n    - miracle in a bottle.\\n    - the size of the system kit is perfect to try these products.\\n    - you should be aware of the size before buying.\\n    - im on my 3rd bottle and my knee pain has been almost completely removed.\\n    - i received the product in two days which is great, the bottle was really small but i expected that, it smelt really good.\\n    - three stars love the variety of colors packaging sucked it was broke when i got it\\n    - it smells like they dumped an economy-sized bottle of grandmas heaviest and gaudiest perfume into the mixture.\\n    - the packaging is way too big, even for the smaller packets inside.\\n    - adheres well to tables of differents sizes.\\n    - i ordered three bottles to hold me over while i look for other brands so when i run out, i have a backup plan.<br />great product.\\n    - it performs well and was jus the right size.\\n    - it is more pendant size than charm bracelet size in my opinion.\\n    - surprise was how long a bottle lasts as you only use a drop at a time.\\n    - get the smaller size which i also have.\\n    - mixes easily with water just by shaking the bottle.\\n    - nice size for household use.\\n    - size a bit big and the packing is shabby.\\n    - was the right size for the dog crate, better then throwing it out, works like new.\\n    - these are a nice size for small to medium sized dogs.\\n    - cleaning up after accidents is much quicker, easier, and less stinky.the big gallon jug is more economical than the smaller spray bottles we had been purchasing.\\n    - the size is awkward  too big for a lot of spaces, but not big enough to give cats a chance to release the litter before stepping on to the floor.the cats claws have have torn up the material, so it looks kinda bad, but only if you get within a few feet.all in all, not worth it.\\n    - i wish they came in a bigger size.\\n    - i love it  i just ordered another bottle!\\n    - packaging love the brush.\\n    - maintenance the packaging doesnt really say much about how to clean it, but it appears to just need a straight-forward rinsing out with water.\\n    - i am sending back all 3 bottles for a refund.\\n    - i got two different sizes and found that the smaller one is too small, the larger too big.\\n    - i have the medium sizes for my cat.\\n    - and, its in a huge bottle, compared to the other sizes ive received from companies selling essential oils.\\n    - tried the clicker, tried a whistle, tried a bell, tried a squirt water bottle, tried a handheld horn, citronella collar.\\n    - even the size & packaging is well put together too.\\n    - the description did not provide the size.\\n    - i plan to continue using this product, nature wise has even graciously sent me a free bottle!\\n    - these are the original type of toothbrushes that come with the sonicare same size, and brushtype.<br /><br />these brushes are very good, however because of the fast brushing, and when using it together with the uv-bacteria killing bulb, the blue lines on the brush fade quite fast blue hairs that become white are an indicator of changing the brush.<br /><br />if you ask me, the brush is perfect, not too hard, not too soft, brushes well between the teeth.<br /><br />however at the rate that brushes need to be replaced, and considering their size, they should sell them for half the price.<br />i still think $10/brush is a ripoff \\n    - was not the right size\\n    - with the appropriate thinner, a bottle lasts several weeks.<br />3.\\n    - i guess ill have to try the jumbo size so that he cant reach all the food at once.\\n    - good to find some in the regular packaging until we find out what almay really did to their makeup products.\\n    - i recommend these to everyone just pick one size bigger if your pup is furry.\\n    - it had a couple of paws size slots in the side to display the product that were smaller than the toy balls and my cats have about beaten it to pulp playing with it and trying to get them out, so i was looking for a similar toy with sturdier, more durable materials.my cats can not get the toys out of my homemade one, and that is what keeps them fascinated with it.\\n    - i am giving this for christmas and   very nice packaging!\\n    - there were a few spots that needed treatment so the bottle ran out quickly.\\n    - my original purchase last october 2012, the bottle worked fine.\\n    - ive used the recommended serving size for their water dish, and they drink water as frequently as they did before and there dont seem to be any issues.\\n    - it was the size i needed and could not find in a retail store.\\n    - i initially bought this about five six years ago when the female rabbit i had then took to ripping off the metal sipper part of every water bottle i tried.\\n    - please be aware that you are buying 2 bottles when you order this.\\n    - however, it was advertised as the size that will hold 25+ lbs of dog food, and this is absolutely not true.\\n    - im disappointed pleasant barbershop bay rum, coffee, and vanilla notes sniffing the bottle but the scent fades 30 seconds after application.\\n    - ive ordered it for her about a half dozen times now and im about to order another bottle.\\n    - i bought the 48 x 30 x33 crate to safely contain dogs of all sizes for when i need to go to the store or out to dinner or something while im boarding.i had one of those metal playpens standing sides but no roof or bottom that you could set-up into different sizes.\\n    - this will work with a full-size bed if you tighten the wrist/ankle connector straps.\\n    - useless.i bought a whole bottle to have on supply for a potential mishap, and one involving my a88hole cat peeing on my brand new couch has occurred.its been 4 heavy applications over a weeks time - [@] a month in & my cushion still stinks.1.\\n    - great tasting powder and easily mixes with water in a regular water bottle.\\n    - i use this for my smaller dogs and just cut down the size, you will receive a cheat sheet to show you how much to use per poundage of your pet.\\n    - this razor replaced my parker 22r because it can reach the hard to get ares like right under my nose whereas the parkes head size and angle didnt allow the blade to reach that area.\\n    - this shirt is a must have for tea cup size doggies lol\\n    - finally found the perfect water bottle!\\n    - a medium sized dog that is not an aggressive chewer would be the perfect candidate for this toy.\\n    - this site doesnt show different sizes.\\n    - regardless of size changes, the taste is what matters and it is decidedly inferior to what it has been.\\n    - 2 slightly larger holes 3 possibly make the box slightly larger 4 or keep current size but get rid of that lip popping up at the bottom of the opening so they can lay half in and half out.typically i dont take points off because they dont play with a toy, as i know that other cats probably would.\\n    - she emailed me back in a timely manner and informed me to leave my feedback, email her back with a link to my feedback, and i would be given a free bottle of whatever of their products i wanted regardless of good/bad feedback.\\n    - holds different sizes of lipstick tubes perfectly!\\n    - i have long wavy hair that becomes very frizzy during the spring/summer months and this really keeps it under control for a day until the next wash. now, i use way more that a pea size.\\n    - size is smaller than what is pictured.\\n    - i followed the guide on line for size and fit and it was just the size i needed.\\n    - love this fragrance the roller bottle is a perfect way to experience a high-end fragrance at an affordable price.\\n    - i would recommend the next size up if your pet is any larger than that, though!\\n    - it heats up super fast and is the perfect size!\\n    - and yes, you must read the bottle of every essential oil because the labels can sometimes be intentionally misleading.\\n    - i would buy another costume from this company again.the size small fit my cat very well.\\n    - i take maybe a pea-sized amount and massage it in small circles all over my face and eye area after cleansing and toning my skin with other natural products, and the regiment seems to be making a world of difference!\\n    - since i have wood floors, i purchased a piece of outdoor carpet and cut it to size.\\n    - the bottle is broken, however i did not return .\\n    - these larger size wipes work well for cleaning up adults who need daily hygiene care.\\n    - larger size for larger bathroom, smaller size for 1/2 bath and purse size for when your visiting.\\n    - i cant imagine putting a medium sized dog in there, that is very cruel.if you are to put a medium sized dog in there use the largest cage.\\n    - i couldnt detect any fish scent unless i put my nose inside the bottle.\\n    - you have two loading options, with the top being a great option for skittish or ill animals, the size 24.05 x 16.76 x 14.5 is great for either my regular or my larger cat, or a small dog, and its easy to take apart and clean should an accident happen.we love our other petmate carriers, but we are donating them to a shelter to replace them both with this model.\\n    - i did notice, though, that the pump stopped working about halfway through the bottle.\\n    - so after the first bottle, i had to order more - 2!!!\\n    - im not all the way finish with the bottle but i have notice a change in my size.\\n    - these non-folding, absorbent, adequately-sized pads are comfortable.\\n    - i was suprised by the size of this sponge-it was huge, though i have small hands, the outside shape is exactly to hold with comfort, inside part is softer-great for the skin, and outside-to scrub the feet.\\n    - fantastic product poor packaging its the same i.c.e.\\n    - be sure to take a sip from your water bottle before you put these in.\\n    - they are always thiick clean and come in nice packaging i have four dogs and they all love them.\\n    - i liked it so i put the bottle next to the sink and now use it after each dish wash/hand wash. my hands are so soft!!\\n    - it fits, but its almost at the smallest size i can make it and still seems to be a bit on the big side.\\n    - good size, fast shipping\\n    - i also agree with the previous person  people think this is the one with spf just because it comes in the same bottle.\\n    - pouch lasts a for about 1.5 months in a 30 gallon tank with three 5 goldfish.used in conjunction with an marineland emperor 280 and rite- size e filter cartridges.\\n    - i didnt find out these ear plugs come in different sizes until after i ordered.\\n    - the bottle alone looked difficult to manage in our cold winters so i also purchased the thirsty tote.\\n    - nice size   good quality nice size  good quality\\n    - i purchased the green one, and the color doesnt come up as dark as the color of the bottle, but i didnt expect it too.\\n    - i cant tell the difference after one bottle.\\n    - i love the packaging because they stay moist.\\n    - one of my cats threw up daily, the other every once in a while.switched to science diet which is only a little more for about the same size bag, the cats stopped puking within a couple days, they had more energy, seemed happier.and the bag has lasted 3 1/2 months and it will last us a total of 4 months when we finish this bag up.pro plan makes my cats act/seem just like the cheap cat food.\\n    - they sand me small size.and i cant be bothered sand it back,so i got stock with it.\\n    - great bed -waay to much packaging!.\\n    - the squirrels are perfect sized for him i lordered the large size in the option field he loves to pull them out of the squirrels house.\\n    - i had to take it away from after about 10 minutes because i was afraid eating all the fur she was pulling out would make her sick.i am packaging up this toy to return.i think the manufacturer should take invincible out of the name or improve the product.\\n    - well after seeing no results from this bottle i have come to the conclusion it is a fake!\\n    - it is a nice size and pretty durable considering two dogs are chewing on it.\\n    - ive heard of other products having bad packaging, but when my came in they were each individually wrapped, placed in their own box, and then both boxes were placed in a large box with wrapping.\\n    - it came in a plastic packaging and also a little blue gift bag with some tissue.\\n    - tnx i made the photo of my old 4 years sponge and the new one i just received today, they are very strong and last long, i like even smaller size\\n    - the biggest overall downside for me was the size of the head.\\n    - one pump is enough for the face as well as the hair after i shower im half way done with the bottle\\n    - i have two medium sized dogs.\\n    - it was perfect, both of these are still working fine.the bottle is pricey $25.99 when i purchased it compared to typical ball bearing water bottles, if you have a rabbitry with many animals, this might not be the way to go.\\n    - i guess they thought no one would notice the foreign shampoo in the same bottle.\\n    - great price, packaging, and product.\\n    - my sons boxer really loves her new bowls she is a large breed, so we got the largest size which is just perfect for her.\\n    - i think had i put these together, i would have made them fold over to make the business card size, doubling the space for information, enabling the reading of the material much easier.\\n    - excellent results.it does what it says.will order another bottle soon.\\n    - order a size big.\\n    - they love the size--can grab it and flip it--and rub all over the little succulent fishies!\\n    - perfect for my medium sized cat and covers the liter nicely so you can keep out the smell and not stare at it when walking by.\\n    - it takes up less room than the bottle of alcohol did on their benches and they all love them.\\n    - each morning i took the minute to apply the liquid to my nail bed and left a bottle on my nightstand to apply before i went to bed.\\n    - this little cell phone sized light is a miracle.\\n    - i love it the two bottles shampoo and conditioner are perfet set, do the job that i expect every body loves my gray hair\\n    - i reordered the same color and bottle.\\n    - weve been using them for a few weeks now and really like them.they come in three sizes that are good for smaller portions.\\n    - however would like to see more attractive packaging and bottle.\\n    - love this lotion love this lotion, but wish i had actually read the size of the bottle.\\n    - missrepresented but still acceptable just as expected except the bottle we got appears to be a floor display model, meaning there is no charm on the bottle like normal.\\n    - you only need one a day and i buy the 90 count bottle so i have a 3 month supply.\\n    - not the size shown.\\n    - one bottle which is quite large lasts my husband and i about 2 months.\\n    - i just ordered a second bottle of this product and their pycnogenol complex to see if it helps me to decrease hot flashes as one reviewer noted.\\n    - i dont think the neck area, at least for her body type, is the important measurement when trying to decide on what size to order, since the harness isnt really designed to fit around the neck.\\n    - tiny kitten sized toy.\\n    - the other bottles are worthless without the roller balls\\n    - it gets two stars for the packaging and antioxidants, ceramides, and niacinamide, but thats it.\\n    - i did get a free bottle to .\\n    - after that force the included straws see photos i uploaded into the bottle.\\n    - theres nothing on the packaging that says it is.\\n    - that being said,pros  1.very realistic and natural looking teeth,not super,fake looking white.2.the one size fits all really does seem to fit most,i am male and it fits nearly perfect,although i have heard,for most females it may be a little big,but it can be bent and molded to still fit fine.3.\\n    - i was surprised when it arrived as to the size, for some reason i thought it would be larger i have an aussie, a rottie and a part-great pyrenees, so they are big dogs themselves.\\n    - i really like the size of this item, but the vibration quit after the first use.\\n    - sturdy, standard size, handy dispenser.\\n    - nice size and hold up well\\n    - i saw that they also offer a spray bottle of their solution, but i made my own in a 2oz spray bottle that i purchased at a local store.\\n    - ill report back once i finish the bottle.\\n    - looses suction, best to get a squirt bottle for enemas yull be happier\\n    - to our surprise, the brush heads arrived in clairsonic branded packaging.\\n    - and unlike other water bottles that have to be completely filled to the top to get a good seal or else it will leak this one does not.\\n    - it is the perfect compliment to your bathroom decor, and just the right size too.\\n    - currently its priced at $8.18, while the exact same bottle in lavender is priced at $3.33, why?<br /><br />anyway, while its a nice hand sanitizer, i dont think its worth the price difference, ill be looking for an alternative until amazon or eo products fixes the pricing issue.\\n    - a waste of money this is expensive for a sample size product, but i am glad i did not waste my money on the bigger size.\\n    - i didnt think anything of it until i started using it and found no results from this bottle.\\n    -

so i decided a soft crate was in order, but it was difficult to find one that would be the right size for my dog and still fit in my vehicle.\\n    - paid a small fortune for a travel size product.\\n    - it is easy to wipe down and the stainless steel bowls come out easily to wash and refill.my only gripe is that i purchased a gray food-grade silicone mat from the same company in size small thinking that this pet feeder would fit nicely underneath it to catch any stray bits of food.\\n    - this water bottle has made it very easy for me to work this habit into my lifestyle!the only negative thing i would have to say about it, is that the opening really should be a little larger.\\n    -

i appreciate the size of this protector, as it makes it suitable for use on a larger bed and prevents shifting.\\n    - cable comes with lots of kinks from the packaging, so its hard to get it into the right position in the tank, will have to track down a real suction cup.the device itself drifts up and down a bit, but it does say +/- 1 deg c accuracy.\\n    - love these bottles!\\n    - the packaging is fantastic!\\n    - i use about the same size as the diameter of the tube oriface.\\n    - the case has some weight to it, but not much.the bottle caps do not twist off.\\n    - after the bottle ran out, i was trying to use up some other leftover shampoos we had lying around  mostly popular brand name anti-dandruff shampoos, which still work for my dad.\\n    - ok.. this mouthwash i got the small bottle true true as said it taste gross really really bad it stays in your mouth gross its not fresh as said it doesent taste like it smells but it smells really good but taste!!\\n    - the first unit received was missing a control button.the manufacturer responded very quickly to my complaint and sent a new unit which arrived the day after i called-a+ for customer support.the problem with this device is that it way more complicatedrelatively to use than the simple neti pot or squeeze bottle and accomplishes only the same results.admittedly i was seduced by the high tech,clinical look of the item but quickly reverted to old tried and true method of nasal irrigation-squeeze bottle, after a couple of weeks.\\n    - my dog is about 8 pounds and i would recommend the larger size.\\n    - not only are the bristles soft, but its also perfect size to get into tight spots.\\n    - they fool you into thinking you are purchasing a regular size pencil when in reality you are only getting 3 inches or so of makeup, the rest of the product is empty and a waste of resources.\\n    - my dogs is 56 pounds and very strong but is far from rowdy,  she plays with children, plays with all friendly dogs and as a matter of fact is afraid of most a dogs half her size if they bark of growl.i definitely would not waste my money if your dog has separation anxiety and is determined.\\n    - while this outfit looks cute on her, i bought a small and it was still big so i had to adjust it myself.product arrived on time with no problems and as described other than the size issue.\\n    - the plastic is durable, the bowls are a nice size and super handy because theyre removable.\\n    - product is wonderful the shipping price was 44.00 such a rip off on 9 3 oz bottles.\\n    - if coke and pepsi can add this detail to all of their bottles, how can kaytee overlook such a potentially critical detail?\\n    - i like the packaging as well.\\n    - sorry just not like the picture im perplexed with what i think about this bag - the size is great for me i dont need a big bag - the colors rrr fun and the fabric is cool as well as the handle design can go from one to two strap thats cool - but the bag doesnt close properly the flap isnt wide enough to keep contents in the bag - the sides over lap 2in on each side - bummer - ill keep it to store my girly things in may even use it to tote around crochet projects around the fort - but i dont trust carrying around anything valuable<br />peace and grace and so you know love won\\n    - the complete range of sizes is a huge plus, but only if you use rechargeables in all those sizes.\\n    - its a great size and definitely gives hours of delightful fun ;\\n    - i got this toner in a travel size as part of a gift box years ago and loved how well it evened out my skin, i have never used another product that worked this well or this quickly.\\n    - not for full sized trucks.\\n    - the larger size seemed essential back when i had multiple dogs, but the new one is probably perfect for one.\\n    - i brought the bottle with me to my next doctors appointment, and my physician agreed that actifolate should theoretically be a good substutute for deplin.\\n    - the bottle it comes in is great and easy to use in the shower.\\n    - my husband removed the oil bottle from the diffuser and dipped a cotton swab into the oil and wiped it on all the cfl bulbs in our living area and let the beast in to hunt down moses.\\n    - its been a little over a month now, just finished the 1st bottle the other day.\\n    - reasonable size.. but the $14.95 price is a little too high.. other cosmetic brands have about the same product for way cheaper..\\n    - right now, im enveloped in caroline herrera, which is stunning and which bowled me over when i sniffed it in the bottle.\\n    - of course, she sees me pour my bottled water in the bowl, so it must be a good thing.\\n    - the water bottle is very tiny and mine has already leaked all the way out once and soaked the shavings on the whole floor.\\n    - i wish amazon prime was available for all sizes.\\n    - one bottle has lasted me for months.<br /><br />i have used so many different products to simply reduce the age/sun spots on my face, but had no idea lytera would actually make them literally disappear.\\n    - not the size promised.\\n    - the body of the suit fit me i wear a size 8 pants.\\n    - this time around it seemed to have less in the packaging.\\n    - one of our many goals is to convert these birds to fresh vegetables, fruits, and other wholesome and nutritious foods, and this includes the introduction to pellets for a completely balanced nutritional diet.the small size of hagen tropican is a perfect size to try on birds, that way you are not heavily invested in a pellet brand that does not appeal to them.\\n    - her water bottle even attaches to the sides because they are wire another reason we went with this model.\\n    - i love the pump bottles, i use it every day\\n    - buying it at home depot will save you coin over even the amazon price, as here it is about $4.50 a bottle, and at home depot it is $3.99 a bottle.\\n    - while this works for my needs, and the price was ok for the size, beware if you really need the larger size container!\\n    - we are on our third bottle and hes still going strong!\\n    - i took it as directed on the bottle.\\n    - ill admit my vision isnt what it used to be, but it shouldnt be necessary to remove the bottle every day to check out remaining supply.\\n    - next time, i remembered that i do not need a dime size.\\n    - not recommended for any dog of any size!\\n    - youll probably drop the bottle repeatedly getting the outer lid off, but there is fortunately an inner screw top.\\n    - the 18 was ok, but extremely tight for someone of my size.\\n    - great oil brought this with two other oils the bottles are pretty big , the oils are lite and absorbs in the skin quickly i forgot i was buying them for my hair after i seen how nicely it felt on my skin.\\n    - cut to size.\\n    - it is 55 wide and most full size truck seats are 60.\\n    - although now ive almost finished this bottle, it was about 2 weeks after i started taking this supplement that i happily noticed i could cross my right leg over my left knee w/o any right hip pain nor was there any bilateral knee pain.\\n    - very convenient packaging if you use a lot of bobby pins with a daughter whos in theater and is a majorette, we were going through bobby pins like nobodys business!\\n    - i will definitely be purchasing this product again, as a matter of fact i just ordered 2 more bottles.\\n    - perfect size for spices.\\n    - one star bottle of something but i cant call it shampoo\\n    - its a bit tricky and you have to wrangle the bottle into it.\\n    - mixes terribly, serving size is too small so you have to use multiple servings to get decent amount of protein, tastes bad, doesnt come with a scoop.\\n    - i have a 135 lb mastiff and i bought the largest size.\\n    - good product keeps em cleak, packaging needs improvement.\\n    - having had low thyroid, we always assumed my hair was falling out because of that.but after receiving large doses of anti-inflammatory medicine, it stopped.i had purchased a bottle of advanced 95 before surgery, so when i returned home i began taking it on a regular basis, along with a bioperene and a now dha 500. i noticed that while taking the curcumin, the healing of my scalp was continuing and my hair loss had become negligible.\\n    - i give 4 stars because it didnt go away after a month and half of use and also it is costly for the size of the bottle and i could not afford to keep using it for that reason.\\n    - i have to assume these bottles have been stockpiled and now being sold.\\n    - it is a must have skin care and i would suggest to buy this larger size.<br /><br />ps i am hope that they would even offer the 240ml size!\\n    - had to write this for a free bottle omega 3. there ya go.\\n    - thursday morning, after more research, i went out and bought a bottle of bactine.\\n    - how can u sand the wrong size??\\n    - turned around and purchased the larger size!\\n    - no drip water bottle.\\n    - i have a puggle which is a small-medium sized dog, and if i stopped too hard or suddenly there have been times where shed fly and topel over onto the floor boards.\\n    - love the fragrance i love the fragrance and that it isnt alcohol, that it is a natural product .good size to carry in the purse.\\n    - the way the add reads one size fits all.not true must have a shoe size to correct size of sock but does not let you know this.come only for a shoe size of 7 - 71/2.\\n    - both mu daughter and my son like this hot water bottle.\\n    - i like each of the products and will it again in regular sizes.\\n    - i bought this size for our french bulldog and the extra large size for our boxer.\\n    - this size is a little small, i suggust the larger size.\\n    - wish they had black in larger sizes.\\n    - good size & feel but leaked.\\n    - the only problem with these biscuits is in their packaging  they are poured into a lightweight plastic bag in a cardboard box, and so should be transferred to a sealed container to keep them fresh.\\n    - the 1mm is a good general length to get if you are getting only one size as it can still be used in sensitive areas, just a bit more gently.\\n    - but i risked it and bought one bottle from amazon.\\n    - the bottle has pills for only 40 servings that is 40*3=120 pills that means the bottle is only hold good for 14 days only and based on the current result and price, is far too expensive and i would say just try something else but not this one.\\n    - theyre adorable and perfectly sized.\\n    - that is what i do, i just take a shaker bottle and and one ice cube plus one scoop of this stuff and water.shake.\\n    - our living room is the entire length of the house and it takes a full bottle to do one application .\\n    - right size for a lovebird.\\n    - my fault, i know, but i didnt pay close attention to the size bag.\\n    - i noticed that most other machines come with only one size cuff.\\n    - the pump is a must for the larger bottles.\\n    - the cap was off the bottle and the bottom of the bottle was bashed in but not broken.\\n    - a serving size is one chew, and each chew is 15 calories.\\n    - five per box, use one at every stop and ditch them in a kitchen size trash bag after every stay.\\n    - it comes with 2 cuffs- one for people with large upper arms and one for people with regular sized arms.\\n    - easy to use , clear instruction , sturdy packaging , reclosable package , made getting my vitamin d easy simple and i dont choke any more on a huge pill and my absorption is easier .\\n    - polysorbate 60 is listed on my bottle and raises concern on the ewg.\\n    - great price for size.\\n    - let me tell you, they put the lies in supplies alright  the packaging looked funny to me, so i compared it to the blackout that i already have and the whole thing is a joke.<br /><br />it literally says this on the side of the packaging <br />the ultra charm conductor, illuminates the bee to direct the butterfly highly ingeniously utilizes the static electricity principle, lets the eyelash bythe natural sea and the plant essence cation spread the wings to fly presents the unprecedented volume to curl upwards, the eyelash slender favor, thickly glistens the growth increasea dense and the protection eyelash effect extremely good, the quality of material lithe exquisite eyelash pomade, temprately lastingly maintains you to be perfect accommodates, during contains the rich cellulose, can mold the slender effect.\\n    -

it is twice the size and will not fit a miniature breeds.\\n    - aerosol bottle does not work.\\n    - basically, if its a significant-sized area of bright red, thats where the belt goes, and those are the only places it can go.the material of the seat is a high-quality nylon that looks easy to clean with a wipe, but they also remove for cleaning with the same elastic straps and metal loops system ive seen in other seats.easy to think the should belt goes *behind* the armrest while the lapbelt goes in front.\\n    -

packaging was not as pictured.\\n    - its good for throwing and playing catch as its the size of a small ball and they enjoyed passing it around to each other.\\n    - pays for itself the first use i get a few more days  out of every squeeze bottle and it is good to the last drop.\\n    - while the wheel size is something im sure i would eventually get used to, i fell badly today because of this.\\n    - i have fed my dogs multiple dogs, breeds, and sizes exclusively purina pro plan and purina dog chow since 2000. in the last 13 years i have never had and issue with feeding and i have never fed any other brand to my dogs.\\n    -

it applied easily and cleanly with a spray bottle both mist and stream settings.\\n    - too big for a medium sized dog.\\n    - i turned the bottle over, and sure enough the rubber flask was all chewed up and scratched where a serial number should be.\\n    - i have not checked my weight since im not done with the bottle; however, ive noticed a daily cleansing.\\n    - five stars best ever tan in a bottle!\\n\\n- intent: ask_quantity\\n  examples: |\\n    - i have a large dog so i bought the quart size which is perfect.\\n    - granted, my husband and i work in finance, but we still manage to ruin rather nice clothes in the least logical of ways - i cant tell you how many nice shirts weve spoiled at a movie theater by dropping a piece of popcorn on them.\\n    - with other sprays, no matter how much we sprayed the carpet and floor by the doorway entrance, wed always get a whiff of urine smell every time we entered the house urine gone got rid of some odor but the rest just didnt work.\\n    - so, after hearing that story, i jumped online and did a little research, and although i didnt realize how small and simple it was at the time,about the size of a key ring fobi ultimately chose this breathalyzer based on reviews, and the price.\\n    - i was hesitant about how strong it would be--well, how strong my arms would be--when rolling it out, but i cant put a tremendous amount of pressure on my sore muscles anyways it would hurt too much.\\n    - while i know some companies have consciously chosen not to certify for various potentially legitimate reasons, its still a badge that inspires some amount of trust.\\n    - service is still excellent.i was glad i got both at the same time because for me the sole angel way cheaper--for good reason was useless  band too wide and flimsy for my feet i wear size 9!\\n    - just look at this prices for the size of the bottle.\\n    - this crate is a great size- frankie has plenty of room and it fits in my dodge journey although it is close on the height- but works!.\\n    - so many people who saw her when i first got her, and see her now, are extremely impressed at how much better she looks too.\\n    - i saw some trial-sized bags in a pet store, and bought a couple.\\n    - the medium is a nice size for our six month old borador now, but i bet ill be ordering the large sometime soon!\\n    - sizes run extremely small which is a big disappointment because the quality of the shirt is great.\\n    - perfect size for extra clothes, watertight, easy to strap down and holds my wallet, phone and glasses.\\n    - i thought i would hate the bigger size 2x a normal sponge but as it turns out, it comes in handy for wiping down counters and such.\\n    - its really ridiculous how much money they charge for these things.\\n    - so unless your a lady with a size 11 shoe or something, you should be ok.i notice though, that little bitty feet will not work with these, they would be too big if your feet are tiny.my shoe size is about a 9. i would think between size 7 and 10 would be good for these slippers.\\n    - non-folding, smaller-sized pads work great!.\\n    - wish there was a curved clip for the bangs in a smaller size too.\\n    - good product, but unless you have a size 92 .\\n    - they are a nice small size for smaller dogs.\\n    - i bought this in the largest size for my lab but my other three dogs keep getting on it including my yorkie.\\n    - these are the perfect size for the medications, vitamins, minerals, & herb taken daily.\\n    - the pan can get a little heavy because of the size, but its manageable with the typical two inches of litter.\\n    - not sized correctly.\\n    - infected spots dramatically reduced in size and arent as red anymore.<br />- some very tiny flakes started appearing around my acne.<br />- even pores seem to be more clean and smaller.<br /><br />im numbfounded about the fact that my sensitive skin had no problem at all with this acid peel,<br />even while the description says 70% is only meant for use on the body!<br /><br />im still waiting as to know what this will do on a longer term, but the first minor effects already seem promising!<br /><br />note* bio-oil and sunscreen are not included in package.<br /><br />[update 1]<br />i have just done a fourth peel.<br />i realize now i havent been using enough product, most probably, which would explain nu burning sensation at all.<br />i now use some more of the acid so that, looking into the light, you can see your skin is wet<br /><br />i can very clearly see that my skin tone, overall improved alot.<br />my skin looks a bit more tanned and more healthy.<br />my acne has really improved.\\n    - and noticed that the ketones helped suppress my appetite while the l-carnitine helped to synthesize what i did eat into lean muscle mass.\\n    - it wasnt clear that there are different sizes inside, so be sure to open the correct size packet for your needs.\\n    - i looks way better than the photo and its a pretty large size.\\n    - certainly has made a difference in the amount of green .\\n    - although the instructions did say there are batteries with the unit and clearly there are slots in the packaging where the batteries should go, i have to find the right odd sized batteries for the collar unit so have not been able to test it.\\n    - its not just that these contain parabens which i know many are comfortable with but according to the skin deep site, they also include dmdm hydabtoin  allergies/immunotoxicity, contamination concerns formaldehydeandretinyl palmitate  cancer, developmental/reproductive toxicity, organ system toxicity non-reproductive, biochemical or cellular level changesskin absorbs things it comes into contact with and when you think about how many times these are used, it can be scary to think about.obviously im aware of the fact that babies arent all dropping dead after using baby products - but allergies, asthma, autoimmune disorders, etc are on the rise.\\n    - even the size & packaging is well put together too.\\n    - good clippers for small canine nails.very easy to use.the guillotine type clippers are the best to use for trimming pet nails as you can easily control the amount of nail you trim.\\n    - its a good light but so far two of my leds burned out after 6 months of usage and who knows how many more will burn out.\\n    - it seems like a good amount for the price.\\n    - it was the wrong size.\\n    - i like the flexability of yard size and correction levels.\\n    - perhaps because of the smaller size, the dogs have been very hard on this, but it is one of their favorite toys, and they will try and steal it for one another on a regular basis.\\n    - i did my research and knew what i was getting into with dyeing unbleached hair, so i was completely happy with this, although i did think it would turn out a tiny bit lighter but itll fade over time anyway!<br /><br />one thing i was a little surprised by was how much blue i saw.\\n    - just the right size for 2 pipes and tobacco for a day.\\n    - its bite-sized, so i dont mind giving them regularly to my little dogs, who need to watch their weight.\\n    - not really worth the price for the amount of use you can get out of these.\\n    - perfect size for my snake oil\\n    - for me, this provides just the right amount of support.\\n    - i was worried about the proper amount of lighting since my tank is over 2 deep of water, but it lights it up beautifully and the shimmering effect is great.\\n    - basic charmin is soft enough and strong enough with good size rolls and works well for our household.\\n    - my only complaint is that they are actually business card size, which is really too small for all the information contained.\\n    - worked great with my internal filter, i just cut it to the size i needed, and it helped keep my aquarium clean.\\n    - however, the tiny amount of blood needed to use these strips is amazing.\\n    - the size of the individual compartments is fine for my pills, but if you have lots of vitamin or mineral pills, get the7pack with the 1&34; deep compartments.\\n    - nice size   good quality nice size  good quality\\n    - i have fed my dogs multiple dogs, breeds, and sizes exclusively purina pro plan and purina dog chow since 2000. in the last 13 years i have never had and issue with feeding and i have never fed any other brand to my dogs.\\n    - i still have a small amount of the original halston cologne and the original has a rich deep fragrance that lasts for hours and hours - until the next day.\\n    - i like the fact it has two profiles and that the large-size cuff has an expanded range of arm sizes to fit.i would have wished it had come with an ac adapter, but accuracy and consistency were my focus.\\n    - great product love this product, kept my lips moist and stays on for a very good amount of time throughout the day!\\n    - this large size doesnt really last me a very long time, so it can get expensive, but since it is just about the only product i use it works for me.\\n    - nice size and hold up well\\n    - cant tell you how much i love them!\\n    - great quantity of bags for a big purchase.\\n    - the bag is huge and lasts a good amount of time with my hungry little chubby monsters.\\n    - finally, a regular sized straw!.\\n    - i think they need to redo the one size fits all and make one with small elastic bands.\\n    - i love how much brighter my face look but you need to be consistent in using this serum to get great results.\\n    - perma soft denture reliner kit has certainly rewarded me 10 times over the price i paid for it, and ill never have a dentist reline the dentures for an absurd amount of money -- i can do it myself, thank you very much!\\n    - you should be aware of the size before buying.\\n    - the only real discomfort that could come from this is the smaller sizes but if your like me, you dont need them.\\n    - the compct is a nice size and the color is perfect for me.\\n    - i have a puggle which is a small-medium sized dog, and if i stopped too hard or suddenly there have been times where shed fly and topel over onto the floor boards.\\n    - the way the add reads one size fits all.not true must have a shoe size to correct size of sock but does not let you know this.come only for a shoe size of 7 - 71/2.\\n    - worth any amount of money.\\n    - one of the reviews on here complained about it being too expensive which i dont understand, i paid about 6 bucks for it but ive seen it as cheap as 4.50. how much cheaper than that does it really get?\\n    - i am using a full size bed.\\n    - he said they were easy to trim to the size he needed to fit his shoes.\\n    - my dog is about 8 pounds and i would recommend the larger size.\\n    - the jel-lee material is very stretchy to accommodate your size, and the inner ribs feel very good.\\n    - the display is just fine as it will tell you the percentage of battery left just percent, not time left as well as the amount of time that your current shave was, and whether or not you should clean the razor or plug it in.\\n    - right size for a lovebird.\\n    - perfect size for spices.\\n    - it is still a great amount of product that works well and smells good for the price.\\n    - i thought it was the perfect size since i typically buy my cats 16 pound bags of food and with the 28 pound capacity, i could purchase a 25 pound bag if there was a decent priced sale.\\n    - i was really disappointed with the size.\\n    - go with the 113 mm for medium-sized beards.<br /><br />handmade and the quality shows.\\n    - the great thing about this pen is that it can be made into almost any shape & size that you want, up to the maximum size.\\n    - fda claims trace amounts, nys found excessive amounts!\\n    - great quality fabric great quality fabric, but the bust size is very small.\\n    - these non-folding, absorbent, adequately-sized pads are comfortable.\\n    - i mix just a small amount in with my lotion everyday and my skin looks and feels amazing!\\n    - if you were to buy the same amount at a pet store, youd spend well over $150.00 for the same amount, and this isnt an exaggeration.\\n    - it is tall and thin, with a pump that it just the right amount, but it is only 1.7 ounces.\\n    - these are the original type of toothbrushes that come with the sonicare same size, and brushtype.<br /><br />these brushes are very good, however because of the fast brushing, and when using it together with the uv-bacteria killing bulb, the blue lines on the brush fade quite fast blue hairs that become white are an indicator of changing the brush.<br /><br />if you ask me, the brush is perfect, not too hard, not too soft, brushes well between the teeth.<br /><br />however at the rate that brushes need to be replaced, and considering their size, they should sell them for half the price.<br />i still think $10/brush is a ripoff \\n    -

nice thick hoodie - double check your size before ordering.\\n    - pitbull mix, and she played with a medium size toy.cannot recommend it - it is a dangerous toy.\\n    - this razor replaced my parker 22r because it can reach the hard to get ares like right under my nose whereas the parkes head size and angle didnt allow the blade to reach that area.\\n    - while this outfit looks cute on her, i bought a small and it was still big so i had to adjust it myself.product arrived on time with no problems and as described other than the size issue.\\n    - however, this listing is for four canisters of shave cream, it has to be a pricing or quantity error as it represents more than twice the per unit as can be found anywhere else.\\n    -

just make sure you check your neck size.\\n    - great price doe the quantity and will last a very long time.\\n    - they have beak clamp hair clips attached to the back and they work well -- my only concern is that eventually it may unattach after a fair amount of uses, but that isnt an issue as ill only use them for cosplay and is reasonable for the price i purchased them for.\\n    - other than that it really is well done, designed and good value for size and money .\\n    - i dont think the neck area, at least for her body type, is the important measurement when trying to decide on what size to order, since the harness isnt really designed to fit around the neck.\\n    - when i got the large perch in the mail, i was happy that i got her the size upgrade.\\n    - the size is perfect.\\n    - size misleading; probably should have gotten extra large\\n    - great face steamer great face steamer, very ligkhtweight and gives a good amount of steam for opening up your pores, my only con with this is the water tank is very small the steaming last for about 10 mins but i love it\\n    - the size, and the light weight of the rubber tubes is perfect for her to grab while running.\\n    - it does the job with plenty of length and just the right amount of scratch.\\n    - so we mix it vigorously with an equal amount of honey, and feed it to him with a spoon - it works!\\n    - i put it on my freshly washed towel dried hair-just a tiny amount is more than enough.\\n    - for being able to split the containers using a syringe so that we can make it stretch for five cats for three months.or more depending on how many boxes you buy!\\n    - my dogs tag hangs halfway between center and her ear, it wont stay centered no matter how many times i straighten it.\\n    - check your brush handle size before ordering\\n    - we also love the fact that the food is made with organic ingredients since factory farm animals are injected with such an horrendous amount of antibiotics, i definitely wanted organic ingredients in our cats food.\\n    - its the perfect size to mix shaving cream with a brush.\\n    - right size, catches any fluid spilt on it and easy to clean up any mess thats get on it.\\n    - the best part is how much better i feel.\\n    - they are not dwarfs and i did not want to purchase the dwarf size habitrail, knowing they would grow.\\n    - i work around this by using a tiny amount of my bareminerals primetime---then makeup goes on smoothly and doesnt catch  cant find the right word here on the eye cream.\\n    - i also use their laundry detergent because just a tiny amount cleans better than any other detergent ive tried and i love the soft scent.\\n    - vibrators are quite powerful for such a small device.charger/case is a bit large for travel, compared to the size of the device itself.\\n    - for some reason dentotape is impossible to find around here anymore especially in the 100 yd quantity.\\n    - i have the medium sizes for my cat.\\n    - my husband and i couldnt believe how much whiter our teeth were after using it the first time.\\n    - so i decided a soft crate was in order, but it was difficult to find one that would be the right size for my dog and still fit in my vehicle.\\n    - i have used it with several different sized irons and it works well with most.<br /><br />the one small minus is that it barely fits the 2 curling iron that i use most often.\\n    - it s so roomy, the size is just right for her shes petite and we both love the design and the material used.\\n    - little difficult initially to understand how much to crank the adjustment screw at the bottom.\\n    - i originally ordered the medium size turtle bank because i was worried this was too big.\\n    - i have a turtle about 6.5 long, and the medium size just didnt cut it.\\n    - nearly breaking my jaw and bruising my right side badly when i hit a marble topped table means theres no way i feel comfortable in keeping this until im used to the wheel size.two stars because it is well made.\\n    - i gave it away to another owner whose dog is half of my dogs size.\\n    - i think this is important for me because i feel like my hair is not as naturally soft anymore because of how much ive colored it recently.\\n    - theyre adorable and perfectly sized!\\n    - additionally, believing that birds need a certain amount of natural fat and oil for good feather condition, i have also observed that other pelleted foods are excessively dry.” the tropican formula addresses the normal dry pellet formula with an oil content of 10% orange, banana, soybean, which is a healthier and more palatable alternative for our pet birds.there is no ‘one-way’ to introduce your bird to pellets, it does take time and patience, but there are a variety of different ways to incorporate pellets into a pet bird’s diet.\\n    - i bought an xxlarge for my labmax.there is something seriously wrong about this design when it comes to proportons.i followed the scale of how wide the chest can be per size, however - the strap around the torax is much wider than it should be.- the hoddie is very small for a big dog so it doesn`t cover the ears properly and over all it is too tight.- also the opening around the neck is too tight for my dog`s neck- finally, when you use the hidden elastic straps that go around each back leg to prevent the raincoat from falling to a side, you cannot use the pocket because it is already too tight and stretched on the top from the neck opening to the back legs to fit anything in there.\\n    - once taking this supplement, you will find that all of that is much easier as your portion sizes will be healthier and youll have the energy to get up and move.\\n    - i think this pillow should be a little bigger, also i thinkn it is a bit overpriced for its size\\n    - have had many size aquariums for 30+ years.\\n    - i read a review saying that these units run small so i decided to order the larger size.\\n    - misrepresentation of size.\\n    - so go easy on the amount and apply evenly.\\n    - i feel that a placebo effect would explain the significant decrease in muscle soreness that i expected but would not explain the surprising post workout pump and growth which i did not expect at all.i know there are pricy packaged pre/post workout cocktails out there but i like measuring out the exact amounts of the materials i want that are appropriate to my size, diet, timing and regimen.\\n    - i trust youll put the right amount in the box.for all that fuss, i only ding em one star.\\n    - shipping was great, item was disappointing do to size.\\n    - once synced to the computer a process which is easy, and automatic once set up, you can view how many steps, and how many calories youve burned for specific periods of the day, in 15 minute increments.in this case, size really does matter.\\n    - this site doesnt show different sizes.\\n    - i bought my first jar of eterna 27 in 1991.when you could get an industrial size jar for $25.00.\\n    - turned around and purchased the larger size!\\n    - i part my hair in the middle after a  shower and then apply about a nickle size to each side.\\n    - its so great to be able to purchase such a large quantity .\\n    - i have a 6 month old beagle mix and the normal size flossie will last about 15 minutes until its completely gone.\\n    - no matter how many times i complained to my dentist, my words fell on deaf ears.\\n    - this neck pillow has just the right amount of firmness for our tanning bed.it is very comfortable and we love it!\\n    - the nexxus is very thick, i have to squeeze the bottle hard to get the product out, and when i use it i only need about a quarter size, maybe 1.5 quarters, to wash my very long hair.<br /><br />now im a total convert, i will be buying nexxus color assure shampoo and conditioner, because the price is so worth it.\\n    - the complete range of sizes is a huge plus, but only if you use rechargeables in all those sizes.\\n    - in comparison with the furminator, the oster rake removes smaller amounts of undercoat, which i like because the dog has a more even look.\\n    - pros  the size is perfect for our narrow tub, the feet easily adjust, has a lower rack for soaps and shampoos if needed, seems quite sturdy.cons  the seat doesnt twist as easily as id like it to.\\n    - shes only about 12 pounds but has a small face and size 0 fits perfectly.\\n    - one of my cats threw up daily, the other every once in a while.switched to science diet which is only a little more for about the same size bag, the cats stopped puking within a couple days, they had more energy, seemed happier.and the bag has lasted 3 1/2 months and it will last us a total of 4 months when we finish this bag up.pro plan makes my cats act/seem just like the cheap cat food.\\n    - i still have to use some products to take care of the frizz but my hair is shiny and silky.<br /><br />the long plates get larger amounts of hair and iron it fairly quickly – which results in less damage.\\n    - it mosturizes well and lathers up quite well with only a small amount.\\n    - i spent a substantial amount of money on this, and now im going to have to go buy a new cage that will probably be more expensive just because this one couldnt hold up to a 35lb puppy.\\n    - they are very nice size and im not afraid of them breaking as some have one me.\\n    - these are a nice size for small to medium sized dogs.\\n    - it was the size i needed and could not find in a retail store.\\n    - not sure how long it will last because its &34;foamy&34; the actual quantity in it is less.\\n    - just the right size to carry on a walk for that needed water break thats all i have to say but they wont take my review un less its over 20 words long but theyre asking for my feedback\\n    - im amazed by how many people talk-up this product like its the best thing ever.\\n    - if i could change anything about these, id want to add a bigger one to handle family-size leftovers.\\n    - in addition, unilever may have failed to inform consumers that the product contains a chemical known as tetrasodium edta, which is mainly synthesized from formaldehyde.\\n    - i wish amazon prime was available for all sizes.\\n    - when one buys from a salon you are instructed on how much and how to use.\\n    - as long as you are aware of the size, this is a great purchase.\\n    - i can also fit a good sized blanket in it for him.\\n    - ive been extremely consistent and now six months later i occasionally wonder how many surgeries could be prevented if i had simply taken a little better care of myself with products and procedures - that although available, seem expensive - until one considers the ultimate cost to the alternatives surgery, handi-cap, disability, immobility!!!\\n    - i bought the size that was recommended for my dogs size medium and they were too small.\\n    - price on this size on amazon is much better than our local grocery store.\\n    - i was suprised by the size of this sponge-it was huge, though i have small hands, the outside shape is exactly to hold with comfort, inside part is softer-great for the skin, and outside-to scrub the feet.\\n    - its not bulky, it fits in the hand nicely, and gives off the right amount of power.\\n    - xl for us size m. it is comfy.\\n    - add a small amount of white cream on top.\\n    - this is the only product i have ever encountered that i wholeheartedly like.<br /><br />i use a generous pearl sized dab.\\n    - you can find out how many steps or miles you walk or run each day for several days.\\n    - the size was very different from the one i expected.\\n    - [8] ibid.please, never give xylitol in any form, in any amount to any pet.\\n    - after seeing the size and how easy it was to fill i bought one for myself.\\n    - love the bowls just what i needed,for my kitty.great size and love the print and easy to clean!\\n    - i know that my cat will be fed the same amount of food at the same times every day.\\n    - theres a good amount of cushion too.\\n    - i have spent a ridiculous amount of hours researching fish oil supplements over the years.i eventually gave up and relied on amazon.com reviews instead.\\n    - nice size for household use.\\n    - one bottle contains half the protein that an adult requires in a day 25 grams and has only 5 grams of sugar, plus a lot of other vitamins and minerals.in comparison, special k contains about half the amount of protein and three times the amount of sugar, and it does not taste as good in my opinion.\\n    - it also works wonderfully well on the bikini line and it lasts for a decent amount of time.\\n    - my two dogs love this one gets out and the other is right on the tail of the first to get into it need to buy the larger size for the bigger dog\\n    - right size and next to no weight in my shorts pocket.\\n    - would be great on your arms, however the container size is small for large area application.\\n    - she wears a size medium in the zack & zoey hoody which fits her better.\\n    - the quality and size are great - i have a toyota highlander.\\n    - dont you want to bet my credit card was charged for whole amount??!\\n    - though the previous reviewer said the collar was too large, i believe she simply ordered the smallest size without looking at the description or measuring her dogs neck-- the collar is actually much smaller than the amazon description states.size  w-2.0 cm x l-35 cm extends till 45 cm.this means that the collar should be over 17 inches which is admittedly huge for a small collar.the collar i received has a maximum extended length of 35cm, and barely fits my border collie mix who wears a 14.5 collar.im very frustrated by the sizing problems, but the collar works and appears to be fairly well made.\\n    - the watchis too bulky in the middle to be worn comfortably at night.i would also like to say that fitibits customer service has been horrible with trying to address some of my concerns.i had planned on giving them the benefit of the doubt and seeing if the xl size would alleviate some of theproblems with hr acquisition, but the xl is on some horribly long back order.\\n    - comparing to the diva cup, the sckoon felt more ergonomical, maybe because of the size difference 23 ml vs 30ml or the shape difference sckoon is much more bell shaped.\\n    - great size and lasts a long time.\\n    - match size with ice pack.\\n    - a medium sized dog that is not an aggressive chewer would be the perfect candidate for this toy.\\n    - the glycerite is nice to have when you need a very small amount .\\n    - my only complaint is that the sizes are inconsistent.\\n    - how much do my 3 cats love these treats?a lot.they go at these scarf-style they eat their treats noticing nothing else until the treat is done.a few points.\\n    - no matter how much you tighten the unit, it rattles and squeals well beyond acceptable levels.\\n    - it is easy to wipe down and the stainless steel bowls come out easily to wash and refill.my only gripe is that i purchased a gray food-grade silicone mat from the same company in size small thinking that this pet feeder would fit nicely underneath it to catch any stray bits of food.\\n    - i have to say i was concerned at first when i saw the size of these glucosamine for dogs chews - they are somewhat on the large size.however, those fears were allayed when i saw how readily our three doggies gobbled them up.having said that, we usually add one of these chews to their food each day, and either they dont notice theyre there, or they just love them.either way, were happy that they are getting a proven combination of ingredients that will help them live a healthy, happy, pain free life.\\n    - lasted a reasonable amount of time, but not nearly as long as others.\\n    - the food bowl is an okay size and she enjoys sitting in it and throwing her food around.\\n    - this is the very best, it has the most amount per tablet that i have seen and it seems to be very effective.\\n    - a full assault on both the senses of sight and smell.i much prefer biobags for this purpose -- but my dog requires the large size, and those are currently unavailable on amazon.\\n    - just wish i realized how much water it truly can hold\\n    - was sent the wrong size.\\n    - the pump is a problem for the roc cream here - it gives you way too much per pump; however trial and error i found about 1/4 pump dispenses the right amount.<br /><br />impressions  i dont really notice any better results compared to neutrogena.\\n    - these are a nice size.\\n    - make sure you use their sizing chart because they will fit perfectly if you order the right size.\\n    - the nice vendor we got them from not only sent us the correct size, but told us we could donate the wrong size to our locate shelter.how sweet is that????\\n    - now i need to find the next size down to get the ends to turn under a little more - next winter, longer hairstyle, back to this one.\\n    - the body of the suit fit me i wear a size 8 pants.\\n    - the size of the bottle it is contained in isnt the size of the oil it is a cardboard container that contains a much smaller vial than the competitors plus it costs more for less.\\n    - for the size of these i wish they lasted longer.\\n    - however, as a layman bodybuilder i can honestly say the materials that i sourced through bulk supplements have helped me increase muscle size and strength quickly while minimizing recovery periods.issues with muscle recovery have limited my physique for years but i felt uncomfortable using supplements due totally to my ignorance.\\n    - i use only the two largest size rollers for my particular hairstyle.\\n    - the size is good and holds the 3 gallons well.\\n    - business card size, but with all the information.\\n    - bounty.skinny size?.\\n    - both bowls we purchased had significant amounts of hard, black residue stuck and i do mean stuck to both the interior and exterior of the bowl.\\n    - i used it pretty fast so i had to buy from bulk apothecary, where the castor oil was more affordable with larger amounts!!\\n    - the description did not provide the size.\\n    - since it can be hard to get enough vitamin d in one day, i got these and was pleasantly surprised with the size of the pills.\\n    - the size is just what i was looking for and it has helped contain the mess of refilling her food bowl.\\n    - the cost is higher than the regular feed but if you are a bird enthusiast, it is worth the extra cost~~if you figured how much seed was being stolen by the squirrels and wasted perhaps the cost wont seem that high.\\n    - i measure the amounts exactly so there is no issue there.\\n    - i know it has a lot of great benifits, but no matter how much essential oils i use in my body butter to cover the smell of the shea butter, i can never quite cover up or get past that funky smell \\n    -

good size, a little wobbly.\\n    - first, it arrived quickly & packaged nicely.i havent been taking it long enough to notice any weight loss, however, i like that it has just a small amount of caffeine less than a cup of coffee to give me just a little pep in my step when needed.\\n    -

the very same soap and size.\\n    - the xl just barely fit her.i bought the size large at the pet store thats the largest size they have, and they really dont quite fit her - the sides come un-velcroed if she stretches too much or moves too much.so i came online to buy the largest size available xl.\\n    -

out of all the similar products i tried, this one is the best and most effective!\\n    - although they say that you need to use the product for 4 weeks to see optimal results, i swear, in just a week i saw the limp become a distant memory.\\n    - i take 1 with breakfast and 1 with dinner and love the overall results with daily use.\\n    - my method  -- i used 12 15% gel for 6 weeks that the dentist provided -- i used 835% gel for 4 weeks that i bought from amazon -- i applied twice a day for at least half the time -- i used between 1/3 to 1/2 of the syringe per application in all, you have to be patient and not expect quick results.\\n    - it kept getting caught and couldnt really do an effective job of cutting hair on the neck or back of the head.\\n    - not effective for me, probably because it is a hard pill.\\n    - the clippers are thick and sharp; ive been fairly pleased with the results.\\n    - with those properties plus ceraves moisturizing properties, it allowed my skin to clear up very fast and better than any other product ive used in the past.<br /><br />despite hating lotion because ive never seen any results, i will admit that this lotion by cerave actually did something for me.\\n    -

i have gone through two boxes and it is very effective.\\n    - what i love about this mascara is how long it made my lashes!!\\n    - the results are amazing.\\n    - purchased one for my mother with good results.\\n    - i love the little tags that go with it very nice.i dont know how long theyll stay these usually dont last long just because of how much our dogs run and hunt around on the farm.\\n    - so once again it has to be applied at least twice  a week in order to be effective.\\n    - i thought it might take 3 or so orders of this before wed get such noticeable results.\\n    - i didnt really think much about it when i discovered these were caplets until i realized over time that i was not getting the same results from this product.\\n    - three stars smells great, but only average results.\\n    - i am 29, so i dont have too many fine lines or wrinkles yet to evaluate the products effectiveness on; however, it has made my sensitive skin so smooth and soft.\\n    - i as did others and my stylist saw results with bosley in a months time.\\n    - thankfully they are totally normal the rest of the day due to my strict diet and active lifestyle, but nothing i tried was able to lower my fasting blood sugars.then i tried taking two of these before bed and instantly saw results!\\n    - results are just as advertised.\\n    - durable and effective.\\n    - effective i wanted to get a product for my dark circles and changing skin because i noticed a gradual difference in my appearance after years of makeup and long nights working/studying.\\n    -

my energy level is up and continues to climb.i began with only 1/8th of a teaspoon and am at this time, 4 weeks later, only take 1 heaping teaspoon and having these results.\\n    - great results.\\n    - i noticed that there are several products out right now with this two-step process toting great results for firming/enhancing the under eye area.\\n    - i am getting inconsistent results, blowing .05, then .12. this product is in need of improvement before i can recommend its purchase.\\n    - not greasy but an effective moisturizer.\\n    - not sure how well it works, not seeing significant results.\\n    - to get close to the results i was looking for i had to use both sides of 6 blades and i had to go over the area quite a few times to get the skin about the same smoothness since like i stated before small patches were all i could get off.\\n    - super effective.\\n    - now comes the test of time to see if it stays that way .\\n    - i was pleased with the results!\\n    - i purchased this product with doubt in mind, but have been pleased with the results.\\n    - ive been using it for a week very thoroughly, and so far 0 results.\\n    - no uncomfortable hot spots in the process and for once i dont need to use a towel to protect my ears, neck and shoulders from intense heat as the drawstring effectively keeps the hot air where it belongs.\\n    - ive tried everytjing under the sun to loose weight and stay healthy for the past 25 years and i mean every method, system,group,pill you name it i did it sadly to no lasting results.until i found the gabriel method and was introduced to cellular release!cellular release amazed me it truly produces results !have experience a lot of things?\\n    - unexpected health results.\\n    - cheap, not very effective.\\n    - so far love the results!\\n    - it is not really effective because only 2 temperature settings are displayed and you have to guesstimate the others  the design is nice and it came with a few extras such as the argan oil.\\n    - it loses some effectiveness because even my sneezing will trigger it.\\n    - this is an convenient way and cost effective way to get it all at bedtime!also no binder or filler or magnesium stearate crud\\n    - i wanted to see how this compared with my older electric defuzzer, so decided to try this.it was pretty effective for removing the wool pills on my jacket, but did generate a lot of dust.\\n    - then i contacted the manufacturer  its 60% hca, the recommended dose for results.\\n    - small but effective.\\n    - i tried it and it just felt heavy and weighed down my hair and dried it out nothing like the salon product results.\\n    - ive bought and tried soooo many traditional curlers, and could never get the results i wanted because it took wayyyy too long to curl my hair because of lenght and volume of my hair.\\n    - wisdom gave us wise results.\\n    - lots of products promise results, be curly delivers.\\n    - but if you want an effective, natural, cleansing, yet non irritating shampoo, this is probably your best bet.\\n    - looking forward to seeing results soon!\\n    - if it would have been a real bottle of tanning lotion i would have seen tanning results.\\n    - i think it was effective at low strength; that is, if the bottle says &34;use for 5-10 baths,&34; id use 10% of the bottle each time.\\n    - hairspray on a brush will work have similar if not better results.\\n    - not much to say, they work but are insanely expensive for what they are and how long they last.\\n    - when it comes to muscle-relaxing effect, this product is extremely effective.<br /><br />all capsaicin products require a certain caution in applying them.<br />i always use disposable thin plastic gloves in applying it to the skin.\\n    -

it does have a strong smell but the results are worth it!\\n    - trial size of such nature as to give opportunity to notice results.\\n    - i will see how long the blue indicator bristles stay blue- that could determine the overall value of this buy.\\n    - i love the results im getting.\\n    - it is portable, the screen is easy to read and the results accurate.\\n    - good luck to you though, you may have better results.\\n    - effective, tasty, and natural.\\n    - results.\\n    - the results mean i buy it anyway.\\n    - ill have to try it for 3months straight and see what type of permanent results it will get me.\\n    - i started feeling less hungry just after the first couple days, so i am very impressed by the effectiveness of the capsules.\\n    - very happy with the results!\\n    - the best part of noopept is that the effective dose is between 5-50mg which means this product supplies between 100-1000 doses.\\n    - every case of lyme is different and there may be other things that mop up ammonia as well, but this works so effectively for me and for many other lymies that i often suggest it.\\n    - i was worried about how long the charge would last because previous machines i have had quickly needed new batteries or had to be recharged.\\n    - quiet and effective.\\n    - the results still came back boy.\\n    - now, the results were not huge and dramatic, but they are slightly and noticeably fuller and perkier after several months of taking the combo-it does take that long to notice a difference, so be faithful if you decide to try it.\\n    - still hoping for more results.\\n    - bottom line  great tool to use along with other methods, but dont take the results too literally.\\n    - my wife and i both chose this one as its the most comfortable and most effective.\\n    - easy and effective.\\n    - i am happy with the results\\n    - the smells a little strong, but so are the results--and she loves the taste.\\n    - great results.\\n    - i tried wrapping power cords in foil tape, but the results are ugly, you cant take it off, and the cat still tries to chew through the foil although he eventually gives up.\\n    - very effective and useful when the sun rises so early.\\n    - seems quite effective.\\n    - the first unit received was missing a control button.the manufacturer responded very quickly to my complaint and sent a new unit which arrived the day after i called-a+ for customer support.the problem with this device is that it way more complicatedrelatively to use than the simple neti pot or squeeze bottle and accomplishes only the same results.admittedly i was seduced by the high tech,clinical look of the item but quickly reverted to old tried and true method of nasal irrigation-squeeze bottle, after a couple of weeks.\\n    - it does the job of a regular toothpaste in keeping your teeth fresh and clean but it also does an effective job in whitening it.\\n    - when scooping a spoon of it from the jar, it goes in too easily in my opinion.in conclusion, i think that natures way probably uses an extraction process that incorporates a lot of air into the product, which results in less for your money.\\n    - 3.11.2014<br /><br />i have written the sender they have not answered my note i wrote a few months ago.<br />i went to a seminar on the violet ray the device used on me worked great on my knee for stiffness this one has very little power.<br />it has a dial to make the current higher but the current is not strong.it comes with vague directions.i have used the violet rays for over 2 months and have seen no results on my face on my hair on my brown spots.<br /><br />i buy lots of things on amazon.\\n    -

one multi-treatment so far i like the results that i am seeing with this product.\\n    - my guess why - product is not as effective, less lubricating, less foamy that aveenos therapeutic gel, which is quite similar- fragrance is the fragrance of soybeans, very slightly like sour milk.\\n    - i am encouraged by the results and i hope it has good results for you too.\\n    - i switched to eartborn holistic brand with much better results.\\n    - results based on non-custom trays are invalid in my opinion and should not reflect on the rating.\\n    -

a very effective pet training tool.\\n    - they retained a good deal of liquid, and except for a few major blow-outs, there was rarely a leak.the results have been much less impressive with our second child.\\n    - i have used kreatin everyâ day forâ the firstâ weeks 3 tablets dailyâ beforeâ work out or after workâ and then startedâ just using it some days and some days no and i workâ 4 to 5 days a week i did see lots of resultsâ but insteadâ of gettingâ big am gettingâ cut i got to say i was expectingâ the otherâ way aroundâ but maybe it has to do withâ the workoutâ am doing .\\n    - but it also depends on the person who uses this product with the proper diet and excersize to help get the desired results.\\n    - somewhat effective.\\n    - i am goingâ to be orderingâ some more prettyâ soon butâ read it betterâ to use it inâ cyclesâ lest say am 75% happyâ withâ the resultsâ but i wanted to get big to honestâ but again maybe its the workâ outs am doing but this product really works\\n    - pretty good results.\\n    - i have always used capsules in the past with very good results.\\n    - we are very pleased with the service, results and printable family history with a picture of our sons dog.this is a christmas present and a fun one.\\n    - ive used other products on here and had decent results.\\n    - although it washes right off and leaves no stains.<br />results  i am blushing like i just came out of sauna.\\n    - to achieve the best results it is best to do at least 20 minutes of exercise a day and eat a clean, organic natural diet.\\n    -

great results with baby quasar red.\\n    - great results even on the low settings.\\n    - ive been using this product for a while now, and i have seen great results, but that is only because i have been drinking a lot of water with it.\\n    - 3.80may 2013, before taking sonne 9 test resultscholesterol .\\n    - not very effective.\\n    - he suggests me the notion of testing products in market, and he gave me this blog to see the results right after.\\n    - i also cut out real sugar   it supposedly turns to testosterone in the female body after youve had what your body needs each day i smoke and drink coffee everyday  so you that dont might have better results than me  \\n    -

effective deodorant after trying many brands ive come to rely on old spice for my sweating odor control, buying the multipak i will have it on hand when needed!\\n    - i guess thats how long it takes to dissolve up the scar tissue.\\n    - great results for glowing skin!\\n    - however, you should certainly see viable results and the effort is not hard.\\n    - surprise was how long a bottle lasts as you only use a drop at a time.\\n    - very effective but it isnt a toy.\\n    - unbelievably effective natural anxiolytic!.\\n    - using for fungal treatment, must use for several months to determine effectiveness.\\n    - theres no fragrance, its just rich enough and i feel ive gotten good results.\\n    -

i know this is a bit lengthy, but ive recommended medi-rub to numerous family and friends and everyone who has purchased them raves about them it justtakes consistency and a bit of patience to see amazing results!\\n    - it is very effective after just a few uses.\\n    - the pump is a problem for the roc cream here - it gives you way too much per pump; however trial and error i found about 1/4 pump dispenses the right amount.<br /><br />impressions  i dont really notice any better results compared to neutrogena.\\n    - well after seeing no results from this bottle i have come to the conclusion it is a fake!\\n    - i tried it twice with the same results.\\n    - as a safe-guard, you need to double-bag, using 2 per scoop-up to ensure theres no poo-oozing onto your hands, so the cost-savings of buying in bulk results in a loss, compared to other bags.\\n    -

proactiv advanced formula renewing cleanser i used to like proactiv a lot more years back,  it doesnt seem to work as effectively as it used to.\\n    - have a 95 pound black lab lovable but easily distracted while on leash.retractable leash allows freedom with effective control when neededwill reorder when this one wares out but so far i have had it for nearly a year and its as good as new\\n    - additionally, i like the fact that one can wear nail polish and still be able to apply the product effectively.\\n    - smooth, simple, effective i may be the first person on earth to be disappointed by an &34;age reducing&34; product that actually worked, but  i kind of am.<br /><br />a couple years ago, my dermatologist made it quite clear i should be using a moisturizer with spf every single day.\\n    - the ability to purchase replacement parts instead of the entire mask makes it much more cost effective.\\n    - this very finely made plush microfiber towel may be designed for the ladies with long hair who care about how long it takes to dry those beautiful tresses with an emphasis on hair protection, but for men this towel is equally effective - especially as we age and the amount of hair loss each day is exacerbated by rough, tough towel drying of the hair or worse yet, speeding up the process with a hair dryer!\\n    - throughout the day i feel no joint related aches and it has become a little easier to do certain exercises that had been more challenging due to joint related problems.im in my mid 20s so i cannot speak for every one when i say that this gives immediate results, but i can confidently say that these ingredients are perfectly combined & the results are beneficial to everyday life.the one down fall is the amount of pills that you must take.\\n    - it took a considerate amount of time before i truly began to enjoy the results, but it states it takes approximately 12 weeks to really see results.\\n    - by far, the most effective product i have ever used!\\n    - the purina glucotest packet i purchased was easy to use and according to my vet, the results are reliable.\\n    - ive been using it for four weeks now and already i see major results.\\n    - from what i researched and the dentists input, results widely vary.\\n    - does it work, yep!\\n    - yeah, 3 coats sounds like a lot, but the results make it totally worth it!\\n    - eucalyptus essential oil is colorless and has a distinctive taste and odor.user of eucalyptus oil are <br /><br />1.eucalyptus essential oil is effective for treating a number of respiratory problems including cold, cough, runny nose, sore throat, asthma, nasal congestion, bronchitis and sinusitis.\\n    - if the lotion/cream is necessary, then i am unsure how to rate the effectiveness of the derma roller for reducing wrinkles since the skin can absorb an ant-wrinkle lotion/cream without it.\\n    - very easy and the results are fantastic!\\n    - it provides the necessary cushioning on the bridge of the nose, but the uniform thickness results in significant leakage at the edges of my mirage nasal mask where the pad goes under the mask.\\n    - i havent nicked myself once since using this, and the tiny dot i use for each armpit has effectively eliminated razor burn in that area as well.<br /><br />i also shaved my boyfriends face for him the other day, of course using cremo, and although his facial hair was slightly longer than is best for shaving, it went great and his skin was very smooth after.<br /><br />while i dont shave daily, i can say that my first tube has lasted me probably around five months now, and is still going strong, which is incredible.\\n    - it clearly does, but your results may vary.\\n    - not only does it work, but my dogs look at me funny if i dont put it in their water!\\n    - well, i didnt take them every consecutive day and the results i expected were not met but it still helped a little bit providing me some energy .\\n    - safe and effective a moisturizer with the benefits of retinol.\\n    - i love the added benefit of the coconut oil in these pills, the size is great in that it is so small there is no discomfort.i look forward to seeing results and will update this review as i see results.\\n    - highly recommend both as a durable, high quality product and as a very effective motivator for those of us who have drifted into a way-too-sedentary lifestyle.\\n    - just because of that i will be trying another brand, but i still give this one high marks for ease of use and effectiveness.\\n    - i love how much brighter my face look but you need to be consistent in using this serum to get great results.\\n    - i seem to be having success and wanted to see how long it would take to get completely white teeth.\\n    - easy to read and super fast results.\\n    - ive tried other brands and not seen results.\\n    - i have at least 3 other friends who have used intelligender and the results were accurate so i just knew it was accurate for me as well.\\n    - my husband and i even purchased a second intelligender to see if the results would be different this time, but no.\\n    - but anyway, i tried this tea and saw no additional results.\\n    - an effective, natural alternative to dryer sheets.\\n    - i tried a few products but nothing gave me any indication that they would be effective even after long term use.\\n    - ive only used this twice so far since i just received it a few days ago but do find it effective in what it claims to do.\\n    - an effective energy supplement.\\n    - a bark collar is much more effective than this product to decrease noise both inside and out- sorry i wasted my money.\\n    - the healing process is a bit long, but that depends on how long you have the light on the tattoo.\\n    - test resultscholesterol .\\n    - i used it with my home made sugar, cinnamon, and olive oil mixture applied with a stiff bristle toothbrush and the results were astounding.\\n    - otherwise, its a great product thats easy to use and gives quick, painless results.\\n    - for effectiveness the volume must be up.\\n    - just received so i cant say anything about effectiveness just yet ill update my review once i have something to say but i can speak to the refrigeration question!\\n    - i got my results almost immediately.\\n    - easy to swallow and effective!.\\n    - i am impressed that tropican contains not just the usual corn, but also soybean meal, ground wheat, soybean oil, peanut kernels, sunflower kernels, brewers rice, oat groats, flaxseed meal, spirulina, and a number of natural oils and other ingredients that apparently results in higher acceptance among birds that are not necessarily found in other major-brand pellets.\\n    - great results when you have no time to wait!\\n    - i have been practicing over the last couple of weeks and everybody can’t stop raving about my hair.<br />it is different than any other curler that i have used before, but i found it really easy to use and i am so thrilled with the results.<br /><br />if you are looking for an easy to use, safe and effective curling iron than don’t hesitate, this is an amazing product.\\n    - by making the dewormer easy to administer and an effective remedy, it makes parasite control less of a trial.\\n    - bought the second after very good results with the first initially purchased two for myself at two separate times.\\n    - we used these little movers with our first child, and were satisfied with the results.\\n    - great results for this rookie!\\n    - four stars bought this for my mom, she likes it cause its a mild but effective cleanser.\\n    - was ineffective on our pet-vomit stain & odor.\\n    - very effective and prefer it over anything else ive tried orally.\\n    - even prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on purina one, all she wanted to do was to sleep.i think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, itll be more effective.however, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.\\n    - needless to say im not pleased with the results.\\n    - bought the second after very good results with the first.\\n    - very fast results.but maybe not as durable as it should be.\\n    - i think painting the piece with just plain ole paint would have netted the same results.\\n    - in my case it actually did me a favor by removing the ugly bar logo from some glasses i had, but you may not want the same results.\\n    - i dont know why it took us so long to try the wet-stop3, but we are very happy with the results.\\n    - hang in there and give it time and you should see results.\\n    - oh my hair i have been using bumble and bumble along with my laser hair hood and the results have been great.\\n    - five stars this product has shown results after only one week.\\n    - after this happened i did a google search and a bunch of results came up with people that shared the same experience.\\n    - ineffective.\\n    - both are extremely effective at catching crunchy food bits and litter, and cleanup is as easy as a quick shake and spray with the hose outside not that the spray is always necessary - my pair are rather neat in their habits.\\n    - effective and cheap.\\n    - its really incredible how this industry can make so much money off of mens insecurities and products that 100% of the time have 0% results.\\n    - a very effective product.\\n    - very good,and effective.\\n    - i will try it for another week or two before giving up, but the results have not been on par with the other positive reviews.\\n    - the tan will develope in about 2-3 hours, so dont worry if you dont see imidiate results.\\n    - i have rated it with three stars since i have not used it long enough to see any significant results and because if it is true that the head is only supposed to be used once unlike razors that are used several times until the blades are dull, then the heads should be made so that they can be used more than once and several heads should be included in the kit.\\n    - they work perfectly and always give me results that feel consistent and accurate based on how many carbs i have had in the last few days.\\n    - previously, i would heat a small pan of milk to obtain similar results.\\n    - this is an effective massager for percussion however i did .\\n    - excellent for skin especially mature i bought this oil after realizing some of the most expensive and effective skincare products come with sea buckthorn berry oil.\\n    - the pill looks the same, but you definately do not get the same results.\\n    - this results in the food staying in the holding bin area.\\n    - beano worked well for me for about a year, but its effectiveness wore off after that.\\n    - it seems to clean my contacts effectively, and leaves them feeling very moist.\\n    - thats good enough results for me.\\n    - l-lysine powder is more effective than in tablet form.\\n    - i ended up buying a sportdog brand training collar and it was much more effective.\\n    - while they did help a little, they were just as effective as peppermint altoids which are cheaper.\\n    - i do not believe this product lived up to it   i do not believe this product lived up to it reputation or at least to the videos ive seen on line, but im willing to give it some more time to see if it will work as it intended to to lighten the skin.\\n    - i guess this is not to bad for the price, but i am going to try a different brand next time to see about durability.\\n    - it is a very effective product for not very frequent constipation cases.and even vary safe for daly use, however natural solutions are always the best.\\n    - i cannot vouch that it killed every flea on our dog, but the chemical seems very effective, and our large dog didnt seem to have any ill effects.the price is very reasonable!\\n    - here i had better results.\\n    - hii am writing this review after using this product.it is working but making noise.heating function is not that good/effective.i did massage 2-3 time its give you some rest but the way massager should work its not up to the mark.\\n    - waitin for results.\\n    - nice scent smells nice and is more cost effective than cologne.\\n    - very effective and easy to swallow, i also realized that i got very much energy which is great.\\n    - ive used numerous over the counter whitening kits and have had so so results.\\n    - works better than i antcipated i just started using this product but have had some remarkable results.\\n    - i use this now in conjunction with the hair laser brush and results seem to be better than propecia after 5 months.\\n    - i run mine for only 24hrs weekly and is effective.\\n    - will purchase more and hope for similar results!\\n    - i like that it is sturdy, flat and effective, and not plastic.\\n    - i have tried other eye creams that worked great but had no lasting results or are no longer on the market.\\n    - this effectively cleared up my newborns dry skin.\\n    - i would much rather use a purely natural product like this over chemical based ones, but it wasnt very effective.\\n    - so, i stopped buying them and have been searching for more cost-effective runner-up for a decade still trying.they have the right shallow taper, not like the howard leight hl ones with the stupid flare-out at the end which prevents them from going in far enough and actually seem to make them want to pull themselves out.\\n    - vibrate mode is effective!.\\n    - just needed to have lab work done for surgery and was holding my breath waiting for the results.\\n    - unfortunately, sometimes serums have to be heavier to be effective.\\n    - it is handsomely designed as well as effective.\\n    - very effective.\\n    - doctors brushpicks i have been using doctors brushpicks for a few years with excelent results.\\n    - good product for you who say it does not work you might expect amazing results on one go when it is not true, apply about 2-4 times throughout a week of application and take it easy on the oily foods remember to wash face daily and you will see results.\\n    - the product is easy to use and has minimal, but decent results.\\n    - this is a very effective product!\\n    - so effective, convenient, and pleasant tasting.\\n    - they are comfortable, practical and very effective.\\n    - i went through the whole package just about with the same results, i will probably throw the rest away.\\n    - convenient, healthy not too strong but strong enough to be effective.\\n    - ive been using hikari excel for a while and have great results.\\n    - i tried several different vitamins but never had any results until i started using hairomega 3-in -1. my hair is growing and i also see new growth from using hairomega 3-in-1 dht blocking.\\n    - results - hair started thinning again.\\n    - i was actually shocked when i got my results back, as i had such high hopes at lowering my thyroid medication.\\n    - we have two watches that these batteries fit and it is more cost effective to order on amazon than to run to the store every time we need a battery.\\n    - if you stay with it, this can be effective.\\n    - for my purposes, i prefer the sodium bentonite and have no use for the latter, which isnt a lesser quality clay, but isnt as effective at absorbing the toxins and gunk from my skin as the sodium bentonite.\\n    - an important note to potential buyers however, is that one must thoroughly train the dog prior to using this collar in order for it to be effective.\\n    - i have used this tanning lotion before when i paid full price and it worked than, i always seen results instantly.\\n    - i use it in addition to phytoceramides with phenomenal results!!!\\n    - results do not occur overnight for most people.\\n    - when i started getting results they were awesome!\\n    - maybe that is why my results are so fast.\\n    - i use cetaphil cleanser and i have also used a exfoliator scrub with the brush and the results were immediate.\\n    - hoping for good results!.\\n    - the first level made my dog jump when he felt it, which is not what you want, and only had ot use level 2 when he was super amped.in short i received the educator and i now have positive results with my dog.\\n    - works ok, not as effective as i was hoping for though.\\n    - i have ordered and received my second bottle so that would let you know that i very pleased with the results.\\n    - i use them with my contour usb to be able to monitor and download my results to my laptop.\\n    - i love the tap with your finger to see your daily results.\\n    - very effective!.\\n    - ive been using it for about a month now and ive seen great results.\\n    - the shea butter is a great product, but i feel you can get the same results with any regular lotion.\\n    - the shape of the handle is effective and easy to grasp.\\n    - i have tried other teeth whitening products before and have never seen such fast and clear results like i do with this product.\\n    - i have taken a variety of test boosters with good results.\\n    - it goes fast i did not realize you have to stock up on these things to get results.it was no problem to order.\\n    - a few months, great results, smooth clean energy, no jitters, but i do only take one a day, purchased from other websites, that were more expensive, never again,fast delivery too,\\n    - early results arrived very quickly.\\n    - we used it on three different kinds of fur and it was very effective.\\n    - i think it will be much more effective when used in the shower since the hot water will open up my pores even further.\\n    - below are my results ambient ~72 deg f, test location  center of devicetemp.\\n    - fantastic item so far, have to see how long heating element works.\\n    - i saw a bit of difference in my eating habits also i stopped using lots if sugar which is a good for me.been using the restroom a lot and drinking lots of water.however i only started using this product for two weeks and had to stop because of doctors orders.i am presently seeking treatment for pregnancy.i did saw a change in my sugar cravings and really did not want to eat as much.i am sure if you continue to take this product as advise you will get great results.\\n    - almay night concentrate anecdotally effective i dont know for certain about any scientific studies showing that kinetin night concetrate is effective against aging/wrinkles.\\n    - mixed results.\\n    - i got no results from this product.\\n    - i have tried other soaps with poor results.\\n    - the drink is effective as far as its performance boost but the flavor is bleh.\\n    - overall i am not impressed with the price of this product versus the results.\\n    - but once i had taken it regularly for about a week i started to see markable results.\\n    - i gave the product 3 stars as an overall rating, it wouldnt get any if it was based on effectiveness.\\n    - this one; however, is completely ineffective.\\n    - i use this product along with a natural shampoo with biotin and a potent herbal blend and the results are amazing!<br /><br />thicker, lusher, strong hair after just 3 weeks of using it.<br /><br />now, after 3 months, i still see improvements.<br /><br />i think this formula is great for those wanting the ease of all the great vitamins in one bottle.<br /><br />however, you can probably find each of these vitamins, minerals elsewhere in food source or individual vitamin supplements.\\n    - made me think, no matter, how hard or for how long, i used this epilator - my hair were just saying &34;catch me if you can&34; and xtweeze, just gave up.\\n    - i didnt really have great or noticible results with that one.\\n    - it arrived 8 days later and we tried it out and wow does it work great!<br /><br />it is slightly darker than the st tropez and it goes on just as easy and is streak free.\\n    - high expectations, but disappointing results first, i have to say that the manufacturers choosing not to have printed instructions on the product was an odd choice to make, in that it forces people to come to sites like amazon in order to find out how much to apply, how long to leave the product on, etc.\\n    - it is very effective.\\n    - this was okay but did not deliver results comparable to intesol.\\n    - my baby is now 3 months old, i tried drinking milkmaid tea three times a day with no results.\\n    - i was so beside myself with how effective it was, i had to come write a review.\\n    - what can i say my wife is very please with the product it is very effective for the use it is intended for\\n    - my pores are much cleaner and i am seeing better results from my facial night moisturizer.\\n    - over time this results in static when you turn the dial and eventually entire ranges of the volume spectrum become an open circuit and dont operate.\\n    - .on my second bottle and love the results\\n    - very effective as an immune system booster!\\n    - ill update my review if i get some good results.\\n    - it is a predictable, natural and beautiful color and results.\\n    - most reviews from another site offering this product lauded miraculous results using bm tone-up.\\n    - very pleased with the results of my first attempt at making lotion.\\n    - we began feeding her this product and soon saw good results.\\n    - it is non-greasy, requires very little to be effective and has a nice lemony scent.\\n    - no significant results.\\n    - i just wouldnt completely rely on the results it gives.\\n    - like others have said, a very nice looking and effective unit.\\n    - i used the mucinex on my daughter and saw results after a few days.\\n    - the extra money ive spent on the food has been very cost effective.\\n    - excellent brush for thick, knotty hair i have very thick, knotty hair and this comb is gentle and effective!\\n    - im excited to update my review once ive had time to see the product work\\n    - i will see how long this lasts me.\\n    - however, i found that if i use just a tiny bit the results are okay.\\n    - instant results.\\n    - im not having much pain in my knees at all now and thats all that matters to me.if you buy this stuff, dont expect quick results and you may want to start by taking 2 capsules, twice a day for a week.\\n    - it should come with a warning and a can of mace, it is so effective at attracting men!\\n    - i received this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review and im glad i did, so far im very pleased with the results im seeing.\\n    - i have begun a regimen of taking nad supplements within the past year and most of them have been effective at providing a bit of a boost in energy in the morning.\\n    - beautiful results!\\n    - obviously one knows what to do with a face cream, but it’s always nice to have guidance on the packaging for a new product, like how much to use, etc.<br /><br />all in all i would recommend this product to people who are happy to pay for an effective and luxurious cream.\\n    - when ive got ample time on my hands, i apply the gel, then use compression wraps to enhance the results; at night, i used aggressive but not painful, massage techniques, especially to the thighs and stomach to make sure that the products absorbs well into my skin.\\n    - small but effective.\\n    - i really cant score this a 5 yet because i havent seen results yet but i do know that this product does give me the energy that i need to give me that extra push while im working out, i also know that this product doesnt give me jitters like other products i used in the past.\\n    - very, very effective and i couldnt be happier my neighbors too.\\n    - great results.\\n    - while the writer, dr. kaayla daniel, is clearly angered by the results found and lets this come through a red flag for me when reading a supposedly scientific document - i do feel good questions are raised.\\n    - amazing results im 55 years old, live on the beach and have since a child.\\n    - have been using this for a while a great product always effective\\n    - the material on this pet hammock seat cover is thinner than some other brands ive tried, but still effective at shielding seats from dirt/mud/vomit.\\n    - this by far this was the most ineffective of them all.\\n    - i also found them to be too short to be effective.\\n    - i personally love the fact that it has proven results with reducing acne flare-ups and also help smooth fine lines all without over drying the skin.\\n    - the gentlest, most effective makeup remover ive ever used!\\n    - i didnt think anything of it until i started using it and found no results from this bottle.\\n    - my wool jacket has coarse wool, so no issue with the results.\\n    - sensitivity is ineffective.\\n    - so you have to be a big careful where you hold it, and if you rush it, the results arent worth the effort.\\n    - this, along with therapeutic massage by a certified professional massage therapist has helped me deal very effectively with pain .without drugs!\\n    - i am pleased with the results.\\n    - its good love it, already seeing some results after 3 weeks of using it.\\n    - i will continue to update this review and post my long-term results.\\n    - very effective and physician recommended.\\n    - i get the best results when i use it before i go to bed having showered in the morning.\\n    - looking forward to my results after the second month\\n    - it stays on for a little while but eventually turns itself off i have no idea how long it stays on, my guess is maybe a half hour after the final light setting is reached, which i like.\\n    - hsrd to tell its effectiveness.\\n    - tried it and got excellent results.\\n    - hope that i see rapid hair growth results and hope that it helps regrowt my damaged edges  i like the consistency  not to liquidy yet not to stiff like grease.\\n    - proactive didnt even come close to achieving the same results.\\n    - i really think its effective and a legit good product, not expensive, and does its job.\\n    - the results were better than expected.\\n    - affordable and effective.\\n    - however, this must be done once every day or two to be effective.\\n    - the results were perfect.\\n    - great product ive been using testosterone booster since june and i can feel the difference, more energy and more resistance than normal but you have to be compromised with a healthy life style on order to see full results.\\n    - very pleased with the results!.\\n    - its the best that ive used without going to get a chemical peel from a professional plus none of the after affects just great results.\\n    - a physician suggested that we give this product a try and we have been using it for over a year with great results!\\n    - this is the very best, it has the most amount per tablet that i have seen and it seems to be very effective.\\n    - i noticed results after the first time i used it.\\n    - this product is more pricey than the standard line ovulation test kits, but it beats guessing your results with taking your basil temperature or using the cheaper kits.\\n    - my daughters hair had the same results.\\n    - and, let me say, not only does this design effectively keep the dog at heel, it is very humane because they are guided rather than forced to do so.\\n    - i used it for a period of 4 weeks with no other ear meds or ear cleaners and so i am still looking for an effective medicine for chronic ear infections that really works.\\n    - i tried most of the cruelty free dishwasher detergent with bad results.\\n    - i wish this shampoo was a lot less expensive, but i cannot complain about the results.\\n    - i have a few api test kits and i get consistent results.\\n    - i have gotten many friends and family members using this shampoo now and they all love the results.\\n    - but im really wanting results in my hair the real reason i purchased these.\\n    - results with the vet always seem to be, it could be this or this or that.\\n    - i also used it as a facial and was pleased with the results.\\n    - love this stuff love this stuff, i have been using it for about a month and im seeing great results!\\n    - amazing results!\\n    - i since have ordered several bottles and shared some of them for friends and family members and they all had similar results.\\n    - we are both happy with the results and would advice anyone who is concerned with his cardiovascular health to try the coq-10 supplement.\\n    - its ok. this is not as effective in keeping the bugs away from my dogs face as i had hoped.\\n    - it requires thoughtful reading, organization and a willingness to experiment but i believe these results are more rewarding and the process more interesting and engaging.i have placed this review on each of the items i have ordered from bulk supplements as i will only give my personal opinion on products i have direct experience with.disclosure  i did receive a free sample of cla from bulk supplements.\\n    -

i use the speakers with my ipod, which i have plugged in to a charger, so i can play music throughout the night and wake up to a fully charged mp3 player.\\n    - these last me about 3-6 months depending on how i use them and they cost about 1/8th of what it would cost to supply your fancy gillette 6 blade razor or whatever it is.\\n    - i use it in my duck house, they seem to like it.\\n    - this is such a good too and make pet nail clipping easier because it can be held sideways on my cats little nail tips.\\n    - i read the reviews and didnt want to believe it until i actually used them and i was honestly blown away.\\n    - easy to use and dispose of.\\n    - our vet used a furminator on one of our cats during a routine jab visit.\\n    - i have used this product on my decolette, hands, forearms and face  all the areas with sun damage, and they are responding nicely.\\n    - so easy to use & always great service from this company\\n    - it lives up to its no drip name with the push button inside the mouthpiece, but my guinea pigs have twisted the bottle off the cage bars twice because of how easily the plastic attachment piece slips around.\\n    - great carrier oil i use this oil to dilute my youngliving essential oils and it works perfectly!\\n    - one bottle has lasted me for months.<br /><br />i have used so many different products to simply reduce the age/sun spots on my face, but had no idea lytera would actually make them literally disappear.\\n    - no blisters, rashes, legions or other such items after repeated use.\\n    - best mass gainer ive ever used.\\n    - when scooping a spoon of it from the jar, it goes in too easily in my opinion.in conclusion, i think that natures way probably uses an extraction process that incorporates a lot of air into the product, which results in less for your money.\\n    - bought this as a used item but no mention was made of a serious tear in one of the straps and the absence of the tether that was supposed to be included.\\n    - even if the product had succeeded on the first three counts, i dont think i would have kept using it because i hated the scent so much.\\n    - we just use it now to play fetch with because it will bounce unexpectedly like a football does.the picture doesnt show the other side of this product which is where the hollow openings are to put the treats in.\\n    - the purina glucotest packet i purchased was easy to use and according to my vet, the results are reliable.\\n    - i have used other standard process products.\\n    - however, considering i use it for daytime enclosure for our 50lb pet pig, it has held up very well.\\n    - - milky way midnight bars.use them as silverware!\\n    - the only thing i do not care for is the scent that, to me, smells like the fake pine scent that is used at christmas!\\n    - my brother us an tattoo artist so i will tell you when he recived and use .\\n    -

the root spray does not enjoy the shaping paste i usually use.\\n    - but the results are amazing, my skin is more better after that i   when i used this product i was afraid, because i dont know how it will work in my skin, but the results are amazing, my skin is more better after that i use this product!!!\\n    - my teeth were already white to begin with but this toothpaste made them even more so and brighter!<br /><br />i only with that the tubes were a bit bigger..maybe its because i brush my teeth a lot but i went through one in about a month.\\n    - i own several of norelco shavers and all of them seem of better quality, specially the heads.<br />i gave this to my son as birthday present and next day he gave it to me because one of the blades completely went down, from where it is supposed to be.\\n    - it’s sturdy, making it easy to apply the right amount of pressure, and after a little bit of time getting used to it, it is easy to use.\\n    - i use these only in one shoe for a slight leg length discrepancy.\\n    - i purchase them in a pack then i keep one and use the rest as little gifts.\\n    - have had it for a few months now and have soley used this product for my cycles since i got it.\\n    - i got it because i had a tooth with gum irritation.\\n    - i read the reviews of sweat block and the first one stated how he used it for his face, even though the directions just say underarms.\\n    - i like the thinner fabric since it is easier to take on and off and fold up when not in use.the only issue i have with this cover is the slits for seatbelts to get through.\\n    - after ordering i used the product for about a month and noticed that my skin was supple and radiant.\\n    - luckily my 8 month old can still wear these in a size 2.they have this mesh thing that pulls the 2 away from the skin.which i really love because cleaning that 2 is a pain.\\n    - they came in separated in little bags that have the self adhesive fold over top.<br /><br />i used these to match my nails to my shoes also bought on a whim for halloween.\\n    - i had a leak and it was because it was not inserted properly.\\n    - excellent for retrofit applications.\\n    - previously i had used bags on board for over 15 yrs - but no more.\\n    - it has a slight fragrance that is pleasant to all, but not overpowering to cause a reaction.\\n    - five stars love this product use everyday!\\n    - i have used this product because.\\n    - this is the only razor that i use, other than the newer model that has a battery indicator, so you know when to change batteries.\\n    - bought because they were cheap.\\n    - however, there are some really sharp off-shooting antlers that could cause damage to the dog and anything they came into contact with.\\n    - this product is great for cooking, diluting essential oils for topical use, making home made beauty and health products and so much more!\\n    - used the odor/stain remover on the carpeting and these go there until she is fully trained.\\n    - this is fantastic because our dog was able to turn around a lot more easily.\\n    - like most airlines, delta does not allow these petmate carriers to be used, because of the door on top.delta refused to accept this carrier and we racked up a huge amount of costs scrambling at the last minute to get a new carrier, new labels, etc., by taxi, while already at the airport for our move to europe!\\n    - my pt uses them herself & recommended them.\\n    - i thought it would be a cool kit to take on our vacations as we spend a lot of time in the great outdoors.anyhow, in that kit was a small bottle of this all in one wash. it was too small to take on vacation for my entire family to use, so over the past couple of weeks i have been using it periodically in my home shower.i have lived in michigan all my life and we also almost exclusively vacation within our state.\\n    - this is the best price that ive found ive used this product for over 20 years.\\n    - they absorb the urine unlike some of the pads we have used previously so no run off.\\n    - luckily, it can be removed, and you can use the slot it goes into to hang it on a nail if its near a wall.\\n    - im wondering if this would become easier and more comfortable for me to use with extended practice; however, due to how painful it is in some areas, i dont think ill be using it frequently in any areas, besides my back!i think part of my negative viewpoint on this product could be that im just not the right target for this particular product as im not very physically fit and i dont practice any sports.\\n    - the way to keep your mouth with the proper ph balance is to use baking soda along with toothpaste when you brush.\\n    - the thing is huge, plenty big for two cats, also i had absolutely no issue with attaching the two pieces together so either the company perfected that flaw or we have some folks reviewing this product who’ve never ever owned a set of legos idk but anywho it took zero coxing to get my cat to use it, and beware if you have a very active inquisitive cat they may eat the leaves or fake filler stuff i have a siamese and he loves to play with the filler.\\n    - more bang for the buck since i get so many applications out of this kit, it was well worth the cost the *first* time i bought it.\\n    - the toe rings i find best used in the evening when not walking around or standing for long periods of time.\\n    - four stars bought this for my mom, she likes it cause its a mild but effective cleanser.\\n    - perfect, just wish there logo wasnt there cause i .\\n    - you can apply it right off the stick & then blend it out with your fingers, sponge, or brush.\\n    - i have this sprayer attached to a hose-threaded valve near my sink and use it for general cleaning.\\n    - five stars simple and easy to use.\\n    - easy to use but takes more time.\\n    - it has a carrying handle and pops right out when you want to set it up at your in-laws house who dont like dogs.\\n    - i will definitely use it again on any other leather that needs a good cleaning.\\n    - however, indoors, it is easy for the dog to turn this playpen to the side and use it as a hamster wheel this could be fun, if you wanted it to be.fights with it, at all.\\n    - recently my husband found this in our cabinet & was complaining about his puffy eyes & i told him this would work, sure enough he was very pleased even after just his first use.\\n    - we desired to use only non-toxic products on our beloved family dog.\\n    - website, this is for in clinic use only.intended for lavage of the oral cavity before, during and immediately following professional dental therapy\\n    - used 1/2 of it and dont see the difference in my skin.\\n    - the spring cant pull the door back shut because as the plastic bag fills it causes resistance.\\n    - i also use it on my electric curling brush.\\n    - wasnt worth the money for something you can not use.\\n    - my 14 year old dog uses this in conjunction with dasuquin it seems to add a little pep to his step and help with his aching legs and joints.\\n    - i use it daily as part of my morning routine and dont put it near my eyes.\\n    - i can use the drops in cream or half and half, which is not available lactose free.\\n    - doesnt feel too greasy after application.\\n    - i chose the reduced calorie formula because my 8 year old rescue adopted miniature schnauzer was a little pudgy when i adopted him.\\n    - i could not get used to the rotating action of the pro-x and i did not feel my skin was cleansed as well as it was with the clarisonic.\\n    - this time i used three radiator clamps to encircle the chute--problem solved.my dog cannot chew metal.\\n    - however excellent clippers.<br />however, when i first use them, its noise is too loud.\\n    - i use this for my under eye area.\\n    - again, i only used about a dime size so the smell was not too strong.\\n    - two out of the 6 bottles the polish was thick and gummy and looked previously used!\\n    - have found it to be a superior product to other lash conditioners i have tried and considerably less expensive and easy to use.\\n    - i have an older cat that has never used a cat flap so it is taking some time to get her past her fear and distrust of the door.\\n    - my husband, mother, and i all use this for energy.\\n    - for washing, i use aubrey organics gpb shampoo [[asin b0043hsl98 aubrey organics - gpb shampoo, 11 fl oz cream]]and aubrey organics island naturals conditioner[[asin b0006gzc4w aubrey organics - island natural conditioner, 11 fl oz liquid]]both of which ive been using for over 5 years.\\n    - i also use the thicker fuller hair instantly thick, thickening serum - which i like evern better as it seems to add even more fullness and texture than the spray.\\n    - it is so fun to use that it doesn’t feel like a chore every day, instead i am enjoying this part of my day.<br /><br />p.s.\\n    - on my hair, this color goes on a lot darker than the picture shows, but i dont mind because that dark color goes away after a wash or two.<br /><br />im glad i found this product, because it works great for me.\\n    - it is very thick and gloopy, which made it hard to apply to my hair, even when i used half a pump.\\n    - they break after 1 week of use.\\n    - also when my dog used the system they would track the chemicals and excrement across floor and carpet.\\n    - i soaked the mechanism for one hour in acetone nail polish remover that i had at the house and it loosened up the clasp so that i could actually use the leash its because of this that im only giving this three stars if everything had worked it wouldve been a five star purchase.\\n    - he looks really cool but he is not use to them.\\n    - histamine causes all manner of allergy symptoms  stuffy or runny nose, sinus inflammation, scratchy throat, itching, and hives.diphenhydramine is the ingredient in benadryl, although benadryl will cost much more than diphenydramine, since benadryl is a brand-name drug.\\n    - the ingredients are potent, you can feel the l-ascorbic acid natural vitamin c on application and exfoliation of old, dead skin begins almost immediately.\\n    - the squeeker is large enough for him to use it easily.\\n    - buy a quality manual one, and be done with doggie doors for the remainder of the time youre in that house.\\n    - roll may last 6-8 applications of being used for thumb wrapping for weightlifting\\n    - our first bag was completely destroyed because casanova was a puppy and liked to chew on the zipper.\\n    - what i like about it is that i did not have to stop eating what i used to or go on a fad diet.\\n    - every attempt to roto-rooter out the pin sized drain hole has failed and even super glue has not adhered the razor holder back in place because it is too smooth and is always wet.\\n    - overall an 8 out of 10. i have used this type of filter in the past and it is easy to work with and very reliable.\\n    - then all you have to do is vacuum it up or better yet, use a whisk broom and dust pan to sweep it up and put it back into the box, with no waste of litter.\\n    - paid for something that she couldnt use.\\n    - with no harsh side affects, i just have a desire to drink lots of water due to dry mouth, but thats good for me because before i never could seem to drink enough.\\n    - having used bee bars for years for my dry hands, i love the vanilla scent.\\n    - should of bought a combination collar with a manual remote control which would also be useful in training.\\n    - used to get them for about $10 a can.\\n    - i dont use the built in light for this reason.\\n    - not the worst dry shampoo i have ever used.\\n    - after less than 2 months of use the black protective covering over the lead has shredded and the inner rubber bands are coming apart, making it unsafe to use.\\n    - i bought this for my mom to use because she has rosacea, and i heard this product can really help.\\n    - it wasnt as orange as like spray on tan & i honestly never really noticed until i looked at pictures of me & people told me . but the snooki ultra hot left a nice brown color  at 1st i was skeptical cuz i didnt notice much of a difference till i woke up plus i used jwowws lotion & wasnt impressed at all  im not going to lie the redness after you use it lasts a while but it goes away, & the tingle sensation isnt painful just more irritating & itchy then other tingerlers ive use in the past but it is tolerable none the less & way worth it because of the results you get.\\n    - by taking the blade guide off, for the first time, the hair fell away as one would expect from a product of this type and aside from her peeing all over the floor and yowling in mortal fright like she was about to be eaten as cat owners, you know the yowl and you also know shell be mad at me for three or four days, this was the best results one could ever hope for.if one wants this product for sanitary clipping purposes and doesnt use the hair length guide while clipping the fine cat hair, i can recommend this product..the original review, due to gross disappointment, was three stars.\\n    - i used this burner stacked with alphamine for a fatloss phase dosed in a 2/1 fashion 2 alphamine and 1 alpha t2 and vice versa this was very effective as far as appetite supression, fatloss, weight loss, and overall stimulation due to caffeine from the alphamine this was a killer 1-2 punch and highly recommend on top of a great workout and diet plan.\\n    - the restore wound cleaner was used daily for 3 weeks and we did not have to open the new bottles i ordered to continue treatment.\\n    - pros  -pump - i prefer pumps over tubes - it looks nicer, easier to use, takes up less room on the counter -lasts a long time - i think it can last longer than the tube - which could help justify the cost neutral  -gel consistency when it comes out - it foams up quickly - i havent used the non-iso in a long time, but thinking about it - this paste is probably more foamy than the other - which is fine for me -taste - average - nothing special good or bad cons  -makes a mess!\\n    - thin spots are filling in i have used this product off & on for about 15 years.\\n    - five stars very strong because it is pure but works great for pulling and beauty care products.\\n    - easy to use , clear instruction , sturdy packaging , reclosable package , made getting my vitamin d easy simple and i dont choke any more on a huge pill and my absorption is easier .\\n    - cat litter is one of those things that i hate buying at the grocery store because its so heavy to get into the house.\\n    - sizes which are sufficient to allow noticeable results from use.\\n    - ive seen reviews where people received this as a housewarming gift, and its a fabulous idea.\\n    - i use at night mostly.\\n    - really helps when people live in house only 1 bath\\n    - it hasnt conked out on me once, batteries last in it forever, and its easy to take on trips in carryon luggage, because its so small.\\n    - i gave it a 4 because it is inexpensively made and dont know how well it will hold up, but its a good value for the money.\\n    - ended up just laying it down and the velcro straps are useless.\\n    - easy to apply - for casual daily wear - probably too light for beach days or long outside activity!\\n    - this is one of the best natural deodorants i have used.\\n    - i struggled with panic attacks and anxiety throughout my life -- i finally accepted that this is my natural tendency because how i was raised.\\n    - this is the first time ive used a lip plumper, and im pleased with the results.\\n    - works like a dream.<br /><br />youll also want to use some good pre-shave oil before you lather, so that the blade glides across your face.\\n    - i love these wipes, because i can wipe down the table in front of her when we sit down at a restaurant, and i can wipe her toys if they fall on the floor.\\n    - i use the spatula for mixing product or digging out of jars since i have nails.\\n    - if i get stiff during the day i use the roller and the pain lightens up.\\n    - because the ramp folds so that the traction/top side is outtermost, that means you have to unfold the ramp on the ground and then lift it up onto the van.\\n    - i ordered these for my daughters wedding to use for scattering on tables but it took so long to get them that it was too late.\\n    - i have used this cleanser for many years.\\n    - once you cut the flare off of the hls, theyre probably the best for noise blocking, but because theyre both really dense and very springy, they can really make your ear canal tender, so i have to switch to something else for a few days.\\n    - the second bulb has lasted about three months now, but ive noticed its just not as hot as it used to be.\\n    - i decided to review the gently silken because i just finished epilating today.\\n    - because i am extremely fair skinned, its okay.\\n    - the heated water is then pumped through a series of vinyl rain gutters to heat a table-top greenhouse.\\n    - cant use it without waiting for it to fully charge.\\n    - i used this for years and liked it.\\n    - i do use a green tint primer first to minimum redness.i brush the foundation on and it evens out my skin tone beautifully.\\n    - so if you see those on the reviews, they no longer apply.the products seem great, but ive had so much trouble buying the damn product on amazon, i cannot recommend anyone else does it.\\n    - i was fuming and fusing at him that he cost us money, because i had to purchase another one because of his strong-armed grip.\\n    - definitely the best diapers i have used.\\n    - i also told a friend about it and she used it on her rabbits ears that had sores from the rabbit itching them so much and she said within a short amount of time the sores started healing up and eventually the ears went back to normal with no itching or sores.\\n    - it does work to wear away at the calluses, but it is not enough power to truly achieve beautiful feet.\\n    - ive got thin and slightly longer hair my winter cut, so i used this after showering and blow drying my hair, just to see what it does.\\n    - the first 3 days that i used it, it dried up my pimples and after a week of using it i noticed that my skin is brighter, supple and smooth.<br />unlike other brands or serum its not greasy or feeling like its heavy when you applied it, its fast absorbing and its very light and you will notice the difference after you applied it into your face and neck.<br />i highly recommend this product!!\\n    - i used hemp seed butter in both my lock wax and pomade and my hair is soft, shiny and full of life.\\n    - based upon the overwhelmingly positive reviews, i decided to give it a try.it works.im a skeptic at heart, but when used as directed, it totally and completely got rid of the pain, ache, and sensitivity in my elbows that made it extremely uncomfortable to lift weights, drive, or use the computer.im purchasing more as soon as i finish this review.\\n    - however, now we see many different uses for it.\\n    - meh  the nail polish strips were graphically interesting, but one package only contained enough for one hand thankfully i purchased two packs and i used 1/2 of the second after opening the first and discovering only 8 strips.\\n    - it takes a little bit to sink in, but when it does, i cannot tell whether i used eye cream or not.\\n    - i was recommended this collar to help with my dogs insane barking whenever i left the house.\\n    - a little goes a long way, youll want to use this night and day.\\n    - will use them again.\\n    - yes they have an odor but i use them at night or after a workout/physical activity where i am going to shower after eventually so it has never bothered me.\\n    - it was recommended by his professional hairstylist and is the product she uses.\\n    - i just bought natures miracle advanced ultra on sale at petsmart, 100pads for $39 which is a great price but i only use these in my crate due to that high price and for visit at friends houses.\\n    - its easy to use and efficient.\\n    - i currently use other supplements but this by far seems to be the one daily vitamin for me.\\n    - it is just what i wanted to give my son as a house warming gift for his new home!\\n    - for longer days i might reapply.\\n    - didnt work as i expected but i only used it once.\\n    - i have rosacea skin and it does not cause any redness.\\n    - be carefull i do love this brush and its concept of adding more body and shine but i gave it a 4 star because while the barrel is turning you have to make sure it doesnt roll in the cracks and pull your hair.\\n    - i was very happy to find something else i could use to scrub my kitchen and bathroom without that heavy mop.\\n    - it feels nice, goes on smoothly but then so does my moisturizer which i apply over the top of the cover girl/olay simply ageless serum primer.\\n    - the senior dog i purchased it for feels a dog bed is better than using those stairs, but the other dog loves the stairs and uses them daily.\\n    - i ordered these because i tried a set with yin-yangs that looked similar.\\n    - i use it on a daily basis and have had no issues with the pumps which is a big for me.\\n    - i used to use my tooth brush then i got an oral-b battery brush and did not like that on my tongue.\\n    - i use this on my pomeranian who has a ton of long fur .\\n    - he wanted to use ultra sound treatments which didnt,t help, and actually made the pain worse.\\n    - after applying several other products that didnt seem to work, used this where the vet had scraped a little too deeply at our pups mange and say an immediate improvement in healing and hair growth\\n    - the core isnt smaller - it fits fine on my old paper towel holder - there are fewer towels per roll than i was used to, which makes sense, based on the price.\\n    - i bought this from amazon because of the price.\\n    - i use it for myself.\\n    - for this reason alone, i have taken away a star, and thought about taking away two stars -comes out fast when full - you just have to get used to it -hard to get toothpaste out when running low - you may think that you are out - but keep pressing and you will get a lot more paste to come out -thats why i mentioned in the pros that it lasts a long time -unable to see the fill level - the only way i can tell if im about out is to note how light the can is the design of this tube is horrible, however, obviously its not holding me back from continuing to purchase it again and again ; i cant say whether iso does anything extra for me as far as cleaning and whitening.\\n    - i bought this light for my proflex sump for the refugium because it was a perfect fit.\\n    - all three cats use it  pampered princess, fussy tabby, even our blind senior.\\n    - i  would  not  recommend because of  its  price and  lackluster.\\n    - i am planning on trying the sonicdisc on the windy days when the lighter disc get blown too far off course.two stars because the disc is soft and safer than the hard plastic frisbees but it does not fly well enough and does not seem to be durable.\\n    - my hamster doesnt use it.\\n    - the piece if paper tells you what you can do with it but doesnt tell you how to use it e.g 1 tbs for laundry etc.\\n    - use to love but not anymore.\\n    - this is not just because of the crazy price but also because i like it and it works for me.\\n    - happy to have amazons price and hve used it for years..happy to have amazons price and ailing\\n    - i will not recommand them at night because they leak, my son sleeps 12 hours per night.\\n    - very useful .\\n    - honestly, just because something is phallic shaped and vibrates does not mean it is qualified to do the job.\\n    - this was not the unit that i thought i was going to get when i ordered it, none of mine can get on the topmost platform because there is not enough room to jump from.\\n    - i end up changing the litter much more frequently than i used to, not less.\\n    - but ill purchase again just because i like the color and the fact that its a retractable pen.\\n    - wish i had used this earlier!.\\n    - i originally bought this to use while i was away on vacation.\\n    - yes they are low cost considering, but no other florescent bulbs i use, even more often, burn out as fast.\\n    - the collars appear to hold a charge for 3+ days, but we really only correct a few times a day now because they caught on so quickly.update system is about 16 months old now and one of the collars just failed.it now immediately shuts off as soon as i remove it from the charger.\\n    -

i now use these wipes preventatively about once per week and they work very, very well.\\n    - ill keep looking for better ones ill admit i havent used these before but the one color i liked the most with my hair color broke after one use.\\n    - it is the best dog brush we have ever used.\\n    - worth it and shipped promptly!definitely the best sanitizer i have used.\\n    - this is my second one because i wore the first one out.\\n    - after watching my friend use this to brush a wad of loose fur from her boxer, a dog that i didnt know even needed brushing, i knew i had to have this.\\n    - the 3 from the same parents are a little pack and refuse to accept the other cat.\\n    - im pretty pale and i use the color nude beige.\\n    - i use these with my tens unit so i dont have to replace the sticky patches.\\n    -

our buddy bowl cracked after eight years of heavy use; i immediately started searching for a replacement.\\n    - we use a medicated shampoo that helps for everyday use but sometimes well get a super dry patch that she shampoo does not help with.\\n    - very easy to use.\\n    - great product for oily and sensitive skin i love this lotion, gentle and does not cause pimples.\\n    - the batteries seem to work well, and the remaining battery was clearly unused, it was just a bit odd.\\n    - used this lead last night in my first obedience class.\\n    - they are great towels to use during workouts.\\n    - had learned how to pop out screens so we could not leave windows open in the house and this arrangement makes all the difference in their experiencing sounds and smells outside.however we never leave them alone outside as there are cats roaming from adjacent houses plus we have a raccoon family that comes around every evening and morning.\\n    - absolutely.<br />i chose to buy this, even after reading some of the more negative reviews, because i figured its low price tag was worth the risk.\\n    - i used these to teach my girl the rolling trick in 2 training session.\\n    - she did say that she was not as comfortable in it for long periods of time and felt like it gave less back support then her hefty wheelchair that she uses in the house.\\n    - she uses it a little differently than what is described on the product.\\n    - i sleep on my side and found laying my arm across my body to rest on the mattress was painful because the kush is too firm.\\n    - works well, but hard to use if not familair with this type of iron works well and all but has no plastic tip and the part that is suppose to keep your hair in place on the rod doesnt have a spring.\\n    - i have used these on three dogs over 15 years.\\n    - amazing top coat i never really understood the point of a top coat until i used seche vite - the reason being that my previous top coat polishes were worthless!\\n    - and my little girl is very happy too, she uses it as her bed also.\\n    - i know it has a lot of great benifits, but no matter how much essential oils i use in my body butter to cover the smell of the shea butter, i can never quite cover up or get past that funky smell \\n    - also use umka cold liquid; boiron oscillococcinum flu & chestal cough; vicks vapocream on foot soles/chest; astragalus herb; & young living therapeutic-grade medicinal plant extracts aka essential oils.\\n    - im saving a fortune on pet wipes because she no longer gets urine on her paws!\\n    - it scrubs residue from pipe and rinses off easily with soap and water to reuse over and over again.\\n    - i love the packaging because they stay moist.\\n    - not nearly as big or deep as i had imagined.does not hold much water because most of the size/weight is just the border/bottom of the bowl.the bowl itself is shallow!\\n    - i used a jig saw for the wood door, but a reciprocating saw for the exterior fire door because it was metal.\\n    - easier to apply.\\n    - i have ordered online and purchased in stores i cant tell you how many of these harness type halters for my little 4lb pomeranian and finally this one fits her and she even dips her head into for me because she knows now it is so comfortable to wear and she gets to go outside and play without the lease chocking her when we are walking or when i have her tied up for a short time outside.\\n    - didnt notice any real difference after the first use of a full bottle, so i tried another.didnt get anything out of it.\\n    - i have used this product for a shiba inu who is scratching and nipping all the time.\\n    - will not order again i have used it as directed but as of yet have i seen any improvement.\\n    - heat styling causes hair to lose lipids oils, as does coloring, and this mist helps to replenish them.\\n    - when you insert a lens, slide one end of the lens under a tab and then apply gentle pressure to the frame near the other tab such that the second tab gets farther away from the first.\\n    - i only use the white scrub about once a week although it recommends to use it every day.\\n    - i used a tiny drop, rubbed between both hands, on my dry, flyaway from static electricity bangs and crown of my already styled hair, and the flyaways laid right down without making my hair greasy.\\n    - was previously a safeway dogfood user.\\n    - my dog is used to using pee pads on a tray.\\n    - it does take a couple weeks for you and your face to get used to the razor, but that just means that the shave wont be as close as it can be the first week or two.\\n    - just use it to buff foundation and powder all over your face.\\n    - theres one setting on-off.this uses 3 aaa batteries, which are included, so you can load this up and use it right out of the box.this also works fine with my generic rechargeable aaas.as the description states, this has a multitude of uses.\\n    - i have used gilette before but this is my new replacement for the gilette that i used to use\\n    - i was amazed at the multifunction it has hooked!<br /><br />i have an allergy to acetone , it makes the sides of thumbs peel.<br />when i got a sample of these, i was amazed at the multifunction it has.<br /><br />nothing but these for me now.<br />do not hesitate to purchase  ,  the smell is so nice<br /><br />if you wear 3 coats of red or dark polish u will use double fyi<br />i wear nude colors  so its easy for me.\\n    - we have 3 different sized people int he house and do not have this problem.\\n    - i usually have to use a detangler first and then put in the leave-in conditioner.\\n    - we used the monitor religiously for 7 months and still nothing was happening.\\n    - yes it works omg i love this stuff<br />heres something a lot of folks may not know.<br />magnesium sulfate, which is the main ingredient in epsom salts, is the same thing used<br />to prevent women from going into premature labor.\\n    - and reading the bottle is second only to having a safe, gentle, sweet smelling soap that can be used for many purposes.\\n    - it is such a better price here i used to buy this through my hair dresser at the salon.\\n    - coco used to get an occasional tick even with the oral flea and tick meds.\\n    - i only use it when needed.just recently i noticed my female cat was trying to urinate every 5 minutes.\\n    - based on other reviews, i was worried it might not work, and i did have a problem for one second during first use until i realized the battery that came in the unit had been placed inside backwards, probably to save power.\\n    - i have to use certain facial lotions or i break out im in my later 30s, not a teen.\\n    - the product is great when used like it is meant to.\\n    - i would use this collar only as a night visual aid, not as an actual walking collar.\\n    - i put towels down on the floor and covering the sink while i am applying it so that i dont make a mess of my bathroom.\\n    - some birds might prefer the pellets ground up almost to a powder form and they will ingest them like a sprinkled topping until they get used to the taste.3 many pet birds like fruit juices, so try mixing a little juice with the pellets, but not too much to make them soggy.you may come up with a different solution for your own bird, but do not give up on the idea of pellets.\\n    - i use the vivid white day in the daytime and vivid white night at night.\\n    - rather, the velcro is used for retention of attachments.\\n    - it is mostly user friendly, but not completely.\\n    - it uses a single pin which will probably wear out after repeated chargings, at least that has been my experience with other connections of the type.\\n    - i find that my eyes thank me for changing out my mascara every three months and when i begin to use a new tube, my sensitive eyes give a sigh of relief.<br /><br />i have used all the mascaras out there and need to switch around after several years of using one product because my eyes tend to develop a sensitivity to that product.\\n    - we have switched him over to this kennel in the house and he is used to it already.\\n    - these totally prevented that.but, they arent the easiest things to get on and off and they are hot for the dog because their feet cant breathe.\\n    - we cannot seem to keep them in the house long enough- they literally just get devoured.\\n    - and i love the curved tips which make it much safer to use.good quality.\\n    - drop down arm will make it useful if either of us becomes bedridden.\\n    - california baby vs. badger stick review i prefer this to the california baby sunscreen stick because it is easier to apply.\\n    - you might want to try mashing the shreds together with a fork to make it more like a pate until your cat gets used to it.\\n    - definitely something to get used to, but i liked it.<br /><br />i looove this brand when dying hair, so i will definitely stick with it!\\n    - this is an easy to use and easy to clean product.\\n    - i kept my old scoop and just use that one for the smaller chunks.\\n    - - its not that hard once you get used to it.\\n    - if you have sensitive skin, do not use this product!\\n    - i have used this product every day and have no problems with irritation or skin roughness.\\n    - its neat that you can close it up when not in use.\\n    - we intend to buy another because he is a little bigger than dwarfs but he still appears to like the cage and has settled in nicely!\\n    - am still learning proper application but can definitely see an improvement in my skin.\\n    - it does leave a slight metallic aftertaste, but its not bad enough to be bothersome and you either get used to it or it goes away after long term use.\\n    - one of the best i have used so far.highly recomended.\\n    - however, as far as whitening goes, i dont really think it works because as soon as you stop using the soap, your skin returns to its previous state.\\n    - this was thrown away after one use.\\n    - do not do that because it leaves hideous dried rings around the edges of where the liquid was working.4. i had to go back in with small applications at the rings to remove them.\\n    - i used to feed my cats sheba a while back and am glad to see its available again.\\n    - he did but, again, the litter tray is too shallow, and i couldnt scoop in because it was all over the bottom, stuck around all the rings.\\n    - where it really came in handy with the dog was in her bath, as you can use it to lather up.\\n    - shes been worried about when she walks the dog at night because there are no street lights on her street.\\n    - it is a nice quality and great fit for my bean pillow.i only gave it 4 stars because i thought it was a little too expensive and besides that, it needs to be ironed.\\n    - so its been in use approximately 4 months and it barely holds a charge longer than the one i replaced it with.\\n    - keep in mind that this article is written with examples of potential holiday pet-related disasters, so the use of uncle ralph and the diabetic candy is simply an example of how a xylitol induced life-threatining situation could occur.the seemingly harmless sugar-free red and white mints you bought for your diabetic uncle ralph can cause life-threatening problems for fido if the mints contain xylitol.\\n    - it is an economical price for the size, i like the dropper stopper to control the amount that you use, it has a nice consistency, it is easily absorbed and works either alone or under makeup.\\n    - but i do want to say i have learned not to drink acohol, or beer while on this system because it will slow down the weight loss process drasticly.\\n    - this product works well, but do not confuse it as being similar with the dog pills that are once a month, this will only last a several hours.\\n    - doesnt seem to cause a bad reaction with my two gs mixes.\\n    - they dont use it to scratch as much as they use it as a rest.\\n    - i got this toner in a travel size as part of a gift box years ago and loved how well it evened out my skin, i have never used another product that worked this well or this quickly.\\n    - i think how you use it is key.\\n    - i dont have any real evidence to support my next statement, but our aquarium just seems healthier when we use this versus other brands.\\n    - i cant imagine putting a medium sized dog in there, that is very cruel.if you are to put a medium sized dog in there use the largest cage.\\n    - i could only wear the product around the house because i couldnt wear shoes while using the sole angel product.\\n    - ive only used it once so far but it seemed to work well.\\n    - even if it did excel in those areas, who the heck wants to scrub up with a product that smells like a michigan outhouse?\\n    -   to essential oils use but i will be having fun using all the pieces this set came in am new to essential oils use but i will be having fun using all the pieces this set came in.\\n    - pump ball is of low quality does not get any suction at all and insertion hole of shaft extremly small and hard to even use, gave up on it and may go to trash\\n    - i found that the only way to really get it down to their skin really well was to use some electric clippers to shave a small spot on the back of the shoulders/neck area.\\n    - their were to many, do not use this because   their were to many, do not use this because off dark spots are dark skin, so we sent it back.\\n    - during wwi, it was used to dress wounds, because of its antibacterial qualities.\\n    - it didnt seem like it was, because it made such neat little clumps in the teeth, but it was!\\n    - i was able to use the handle to get myself to my feet with my dogs help.the vest is also very professional looking and eye catching.\\n    - some people use bleach, others like to use vinegar.\\n    - this detergent cleans well and hasnt caused any skin irritations in the 3+ years i have been using it.\\n    - compared to other test boosters i have used in the past i believe that this one has shown the most results.\\n    -

the 1mm is a good general length to get if you are getting only one size as it can still be used in sensitive areas, just a bit more gently.\\n    - i have used this for years and continue to love it.\\n    - i had planned to use these collapsible bowls in the cars and so far my schnauzer likes drinking out of them and theyre easy to use and store.\\n    - i use in conjunction with the miracle worker mouisturizer and it sinks right in and plumps the skin.\\n    - please make sure to have a drink of water handy because they do dry your mouth and throat right after eating them.\\n    - watch out though because they run out of .\\n    - too thick to conceal ive only used 2 brands of hydrocolloid patches for acne, this one and the smartmed cover-dots, and this one is my least favorite of the two.\\n    - excellent product - have used it before - works great on minor skin irritations, scratches, etc.\\n    - return it but we did not, you must wear glove to protect yourself before use it, or may make your skin .turn red and itchy\\n    - i bought it used and saved over $15.\\n    - alas, this is much smaller than that brush, but much too big to use for eyeshadow.\\n    - dangerous there was a piece of glass in mine, it cuts my thigh, i am glad it wasnt my 2 years old daughter that i cut because i use it on her also.\\n    - my german shepard is terrified of storms and so i tried this after much hesitation because it seemed to good to be true.\\n    - i also agree that it has a great scent, and very pleasant to use, as well as a strong cleaner for other surfaces, but thats about it.\\n    - about 30 minutes ago i used one to remove my normal make up that i wear and my face is on fire and is redder than a tomato.\\n    - i will continue to use it because my skin has had no outbreaks since ive started using it!\\n    - i only used a small package of the honest diapers for newborns so i cant say much about them except those diapers were very stiff and way to large to fit a 6lb newborn.\\n    - my daughter also likes this fragrance, and she usually does not like any fragrances i use.<br />excellent service.\\n    - plus, you can use non-dairy milk i use soy and toss in mix-ins.\\n    - if you arent used to the taste or want to add a tad more flavor to it, add organic peanut butter or almond butter to it.\\n    -

great brush i use this to do french tip on myself by dipping it in alcohol and swiping the line clean and it works wonderfully.\\n    - meanwhile, the tooth gloss -- a grayish color to begin with -- broke off during its first application.\\n    - i used it to make natural shsnoop and it worked well.\\n    - it has rolling teeth in the comb that easily remove tangles - must be used however every day or every other day.\\n    - bought them to use for a lip look.\\n    -

i can tell when someone else is using it because i can smell it through the door and down the hall!\\n    - this kit is good quality, easy to use and clean.\\n    - just apply once a day in the morning and you dont have to worry about dryness or exessive oil throughout the day.\\n    - happened to me, had to get a new tank stand because it soaked the stand and ruined the particle board.\\n    - it will warm up and also work like a mild curling iron not quite made for use with a blow dryer, needs to be a metal shell so that when the blow dryer heat hits it, it will warm up and also work like a mild curling iron.\\n    - but i do use it between application of other deodorants to freshen up if needed.\\n    - five stars very nice piece, used it in my wedding and it was wonderful\\n    - she didnt even try to open the doors and i dont think she could have forced them open if she wanted to once they had the extra security in place.i occasionally board a 100lb rottie/pit mix, he may be able to break free even with the clips if he wanted to but it seems like it would hold most pups, especially with the doors extra secured.crate seems well made, was easy to assemble, and although its very large, it folds up relatively compact, small enough to easily fit under a bed or in a closet.i think this will meet my needs for most of the dogs i will board and the price compared to a major pet store, is pretty unbeatable!so far so good, but i will update if there are any issues with further use.\\n    - i broke out like crazy in the areas i used this.\\n    - let me tell you, they put the lies in supplies alright  the packaging looked funny to me, so i compared it to the blackout that i already have and the whole thing is a joke.<br /><br />it literally says this on the side of the packaging <br />the ultra charm conductor, illuminates the bee to direct the butterfly highly ingeniously utilizes the static electricity principle, lets the eyelash bythe natural sea and the plant essence cation spread the wings to fly presents the unprecedented volume to curl upwards, the eyelash slender favor, thickly glistens the growth increasea dense and the protection eyelash effect extremely good, the quality of material lithe exquisite eyelash pomade, temprately lastingly maintains you to be perfect accommodates, during contains the rich cellulose, can mold the slender effect.\\n    -

i will continue to use this product for my brittney.\\n    - this curling iron is easy to use to get great results.\\n    - mostly i find i use this on my elbows and feet to deal with the dry skin build up from the harsh winter.\\n    - he has a nightly ritual of napping on it every evening at his end of the couch.i have to admit, i have used it myself quite a few times and can certainly tell that it works.\\n    - we have two dachshunds who used to bark excessively when someone knocked at the door or rang the doorbell.\\n    - especially since the bird creates a ton of its own dust.we are very familiar with the arm & hammer baking soda brand so we were eager to try this product because it also contains arm & hammer baking soda.\\n    - would be good for people withtmj disorder because of the straight handle.\\n    - i take them because im anemic and my doctor recommended a prenatal, and these work great.\\n    - five stars i mix this with essential oils and use it in conjunction with a deodorant crystal.\\n    -

this is by far the best pedometer ive ever used.\\n    - i started buying this detergent on amazon because my local whole foods stopped carrying it.\\n    - daily basis after washing your face.<br />because this item not sticky, i can also be used in summer.<br />i also like the smell.\\n    -

 - he wont use any other brand, so i think that deserves a 5-star rating.\\n    - i had complete strangers come up to me telling me that i smell soooooo good, and what do i use.\\n    - ive used about every type of male hair product out there and this is by far the best ive come across.\\n    - it still works, but it got left in a house being remodeled it was out of the box and got super filthy, and i wanted to treat myself to a new one.\\n    - i have had one for 8 years, used it every day - this one does not heat like one & did not have the farouk seal.\\n    - it is definitely designed for a lady but even so it is bulky feeling and takes getting use to but it only feels that way the first time you put it on.\\n    - within 3 days of use my dark circles were completely gone.\\n    - it is exactly the same product as they sell here.but i have to say that when i opened the package, i was hesitant to put the flimsy guard in my mouth at night because i was afraid i might choke.\\n    - could eat on a higher surface that way my dog cant get to it.it took him a little while to adjust to it but only because of his disorder not the product, but now he loves it and sleeps in it instead of our bed, score!\\n    - furthermore, this collar is great because it has an audible beep warning, a vibration warning and a negative stimulation warning.\\n    - when i went to physical therapy for the first knee injury, my pt used this and i inquired if they were available to the non-medical public.\\n    - while it has many of the same features and attachments of other hair dryers it does offer salon style performance.<br /><br />notes-<br /><br /> - heats up very quickly<br /> - long cord - probably 8-10 feet which allows you a little freedom from your outlet<br /> - 3 speeds and three heat settings<br /> - the back screen lifts up so that you can clean the dryer motor<br /> - it is a bit heavy, which is the reason for removing one star<br /> - nice look to the dryer - it certainly does not look or feel cheap<br /> - three attachments including a diffuser and two concentrators<br /> - 1875 watts watch to make sure you do not trip your circuit breaker<br /><br />final verdict - this is a well-built machine that will likely last you for many years.\\n    - my wife and i both use this for relaxation and sleep.\\n    - sizes run extremely small which is a big disappointment because the quality of the shirt is great.\\n    - the closing mechanism is awkward at first but you get used to it quickly and can put it up in seconds.\\n    - i removed the bars the foot straps attach to because she hated the foot straps, we bought her boots to protect her feet.\\n    - i used this before and it worked fine, somethings changed my cat has started to get lumps of matted fur.\\n    - i have one cat and use arm & hammer clumping cat litter in my littermaid.\\n    - so please remember to keep some water handy because you will need it.\\n    - we used it on three different kinds of fur and it was very effective.\\n    - just used them on my lab for my first diy doggie mani-pedi ever and they work great!\\n    - what i got when i opened the box was a flimsy, rough shoe, stuffed with polyethylene foam sheets, and covered in recycled polyethylene--that cheap stuff they use to make those $1 green shopping bags that break after two grocery store trips, which costs about $0.03/ft.\\n    - because of the ware flying saucer 6-1/2-inch, medium and super pet hamster silent spinner 6-1/2-inch regular exercise wheel, color red-white.\\n    - i would say only three blackheads came out with this product and it hurts if i use it on a fresh pimple.\\n    - i get so may compliments hours after i apply this lotion!\\n    - junk this is a $160 flat iron supposedly the first day i used it the heat indicator light flashed to green when it was ready to go.\\n    - the good thing is because she has left the nubs, they are not a choke hazard so she can keep working on them.\\n    - a little larger than i anticipated for use on a cat.\\n    - i used q -tip and applied 1-2 drops of oil to my tooth and surrounding area and lo!\\n    - we did not install the wheels because we have no use for them.\\n    - ive actually never seen my dog remove a treat, but i know she is since i have to replace the treat every day or so.ive had it for about two weeks and its not showing any signs of wear and tear, and let me assure you i have a destructive little chewer in my house.\\n    -

ive used it once and already my scalp feels relieved.\\n    - no five star because i prefer the m-80 and assault.\\n    - i promptly ordered 4 more bottles so i would have it on hand if another incident occurred.about a week later i used it again but this time it seemed to have little effect.\\n    - nutramedix, the manufacturer, claims that there is research supporting its use as an antiviral against hh6 and ebv.\\n    - while theyre a fun addition, i dont think theyd be practical to use.\\n    - i bought this for my father to use on his arthritic knee and he says that some days it appears to really help.\\n    - the first time i used it my hair got caught in the slit and it took some hair with but as i got use to watching and making sure my hair didnt go past the point where the handle and the barrel connect i perfected it and now i love the way my hair looks after i finish it.\\n    - i have used this product for a couple of years now and it just about melts away the cuticle.\\n    - zadro mirror nice two sided mirror one side is  regular and one side  mag for applying makeup, distortion free glass, attractive, sturdy  pedestal base.\\n    - used it for years and love this product used it for years and love this product!\\n    - i was a little disappointed with the picture amazon had which has been replaced since i ordered.the original purchase and picture showed a package of 25 oinkers and more oz per pack.i would have still ordered it but feel somewhat mislead because i thought i was getting what was in the picture.oh well my dogs love them.the current picture is what i received\\n    - very useful!\\n    - not as advertised i purchased & then returned this product sold by toysngamesetc because what they are selling/shipping is not the product that is advertised on amazon.\\n    - love purpose soap have used purpose soap for the past 15 years.\\n    - my mom bought me some of this, because she knows i like natural products.\\n    - i guess it only works on certain hair types, because it certainly didnt work on mine.\\n    - you will need some practice of holding it correctly when you will first start to use this product.<br /><br />initially when i started using this i had some trouble in using it.\\n    -

i have very small hands and i can use them with no problem and they dont slip.\\n    - i use them without fabric softeners or any oil and it feels and smells like i did but i also use a tide and that already has a sent.\\n    - this thing gets the job done better on my back than my ex-boyfriend who use to give massages all the time.\\n    - this would be due to one of two reasons, which i will get to shortly.its surprising because something like this is so simple to set up.opening the box, i noted that one of the thicker washers was missing, but it didnt matter to me because i wasnt going to use the water restricter.instructions were good and i soon had the unit set up.\\n    - i ordered this product because i trust olay products and needed a facial moisturizer with an spf which this one has.\\n    - yes, it dries your hair and makes it feel squeaky squeaky clean, but to remedy this i just used my usual awesome conditioner with it aubrey organics island naturals conditioner, not the conditioner that comes with this shampoo--it doesnt leave my hair soft and moisturized enough.\\n    - i wear mine under makeup and it doesnt interfere with any of the makeup application at all.\\n    - i have very fine, thin hair and i use have used this matrix root lifter for about a year.\\n    - except for a brief but very short learning curve, this new device is definitely easier to use and, based on comparison testing, every bit as accurate as our older cuff model.\\n    - i will be ordering one for every sink in my house!\\n    - apparently they contracted midget cats for their item photo.i mean, either the picture on the front of the box is photoshopped, or--and this is more likely, based on the fact that the shoe in the picture is made of something entirely different than the shoe in the box--they created a cat shoe playhouse that was actually worth $16.99 for the picture on the front of the box, then put this $1 piece of crap in the box and sold it to me.that makes me sad.\\n    - my daughter uses the razor attachment, while i use the epilator attachment.\\n    - easy to use and they work wonderfully.\\n    - the slant shape on a normal tub doesnt work for this and if you use it on the side it doesnt reach your back etc.\\n    - its cause maybe by some air get in but how .??\\n    - i have used this extensively for months now and the tweezers are still working well.\\n    - of continuous use\\n    - my cat had a first taste of it and it was ok. then she started having diarrhea and feeling miserable because she felt not clean all the time.\\n    - id recommend these if you use this size battery, you wont be disappointed.\\n    - we used it the very next morning!\\n    - i still like this one, and will continue to use it.\\n    - the only down side is that i have to use so many and its inconvenient, but its to be expected for something thats 36x18.\\n    - for a replacement you can use the canned air that you find at staples.\\n    - something i prefer not to use and am disappointed.\\n    - maybe its because i have a very tiny car, but its kind of annoying.\\n    - eventually they will just get used to it, so you should only use it a little bit at a time.\\n    - i really like it for what i use it for - brief work needing two hands on items close to my face, such as threading a needle, detail work on craft items, removing a splinter from my finger, etc.\\n    - i like putting it on my hands just before bed but its non-<br />greasy enough to use anytime.\\n    - its a little too tight around the eyes, but ill use it til it fits right.\\n    - the pump on it died after 2 years of 24/7 use, i got a replacement, but the replacement died after 2 weeks of use.\\n    - im only using at the ocean because i wanted my dog to learn to swim in the pool and she has.\\n    - well i would say yea, but not much and thats because i wasnt taking it to loose weight, but to balance my diet.\\n    - ive used hair colors for years on both myself, other people even mens goatees and ive never had color fade so fast.\\n    - best product ive ever used!\\n    - i have used a lot of different creams and beauty products as well as take beauty vitamins that beautify the skin from the inside/out.\\n    - great for sensitive legs i hate shaving because i often get bumps after wards.\\n    - use the night before i used to have to wash my hair everyday because it is so oily.\\n    - silk elements fx poshy purple i used the fx poshy purple!!\\n    - i just put her in a few times and walked around the house until she got used to it.\\n    - i bought this because my eye doctor suggested it.\\n    - the wax is a bit dry me hard to use.\\n    - i used amazon reviews to decide to purchase this item.\\n    - i will continue to use it until it is empty and  update my review at that time.\\n    - i have been practicing over the last couple of weeks and everybody can’t stop raving about my hair.<br />it is different than any other curler that i have used before, but i found it really easy to use and i am so thrilled with the results.<br /><br />if you are looking for an easy to use, safe and effective curling iron than don’t hesitate, this is an amazing product.\\n    - we used this bed for our dog in an effort to have him sleeping on the floor in his old age.\\n\\n- intent: verify_authenticity\\n  examples: |\\n    - real bb cream us versions cannot hold a candle to this brand.\\n    - it really works!.\\n    - excellent brush excellent brush, but the remote monitor is excessive  you dont really need it and it does not add much.\\n    - this works really well combined with my remote call and a decoy.\\n    - ive honestly never considered counterfeiting until i read some reviews here, but i checked out my package from this purchase, and it checked out.\\n    - i bought it in the oil free nude color, and really like what it has to offer for my face.\\n    - i dont know how much i can say, but the basics are that this smells really good and goes on smooth.\\n    - it kept getting caught and couldnt really do an effective job of cutting hair on the neck or back of the head.\\n    - i really am happy with gc and will continue taking it until i am at a happy place with my body.\\n    - but they look super awesome and they arrive fast and with some fake   you can only use them a couple of times before they stop opening and closing but they look super awesome and they arrive fast and with some fake cash.\\n    - i really like the 2 braces so i could wear them during the day and at night.\\n    - tell you it was free for a reason.made in a very cheap manner.doesnt really do its job.way to flexible to actually massagemost of these things have the arms to be not very flexible so it can use pressure around your head to actually feel something.there was dry glue all over the handle so it made my hand feel very uncomfortable when using.if this still goes for free i dont even think its worth you wasting your time on it.if i could give it zero stars i would but it wont let me.hope this review helped.cheers!\\n    -

when pulling it along the ground, it also rolls around a little sadly--much less realistic than the original.\\n    - this really helps me a lot in order to get less sick.\\n    - this stuff really works!\\n    - this stuff really keeps away the rodents, which i feed elsewhere in the yard now, and still they dont go near the feeders!\\n    - i really and truly love this hair i purchase it a few months back   ,i really and truly love this hair i purchase it a few months back and im still wearing it it does not get tangled and it looks so awesome on me\\n    -

i have been practicing over the last couple of weeks and everybody can’t stop raving about my hair.<br />it is different than any other curler that i have used before, but i found it really easy to use and i am so thrilled with the results.<br /><br />if you are looking for an easy to use, safe and effective curling iron than don’t hesitate, this is an amazing product.\\n    - an exercise in temporal incongruity.i let the cats torture the furminator so they feel comfortable.they claim not to like it, but cats lie.they do tolerate it, and by using it every couple of days, ive reduced the stray cat hair factor considerable.and the really long-hair cat doesnt mat any more.the furminator is an essential tool for preserving cat dignity.\\n    - these are either fakes, or the product is simply garbage now.\\n    - it was a really different experience, more gentle and soft.\\n    - not genuine gillette - even when sold direct by amazon i have been using mach3 cartridges for 10 years plus.\\n    -

sprout supplements i have tried but would really like a chewable version.\\n    - the bracket really should be stainless steel, like the buckles on top of the harness.\\n    - maybe controlled the bad breath but as far as tarter goes, it never really removed it.\\n    - everything else seems to be ok so far but not really thrilled with the looks.\\n    - on the really positive side, though, i really like the way the waste bags are loaded and dispense - i havent found another all-in-one leash that has such a design.\\n    -

they taste really good, and since i look forward to them it helps me remember to take them every day.\\n    - these are really, really easy to install and only took about 20 mins each which was 95% for cutting the holes.\\n    - it is a really great deal.\\n    - i dont really like that it doesnt say how many probiotic cells you are getting per serving.\\n    - it feels good.<br /><br /> another thing i noticed, isnt really something you should   i am just clumsy in all that i do.\\n    - the reason i give it four stars are for two reasons, and they really are not big issues, firstly, the padded halter is easy to adjust but is like two inches to short.\\n    - it really does relieve the itch most of the time.\\n    - i like the grip of the extras, but they really hurt.\\n    - however, i will continue to use my loreal-voluminous non-water-proof formula for daily use and use the water-proof formula for situations that i feel call for it.\\n    - i must admit that i was a bit hesitant after reading reports of some digestive trouble  molly has historically had a sensitive stomach, and i didnt want to cause her a whole new bit of trouble.but, im happy to say that shes responded really well to duralactin.\\n    - it was such a good review - and it sounded real - that i decided to try it.\\n    - at first he walked funny which was expected, but after we took him out in the snow with them on a couple of times, then took him out without them on, he realized what they were good for.\\n    - the flights of stairs climbed reported can be drastically wrong from reality i heard they were working on a fix for this.\\n    - i could practically hear her saying, really?\\n    - well, you really need to try it for four months!\\n    -

i exercise my border collie, kibo, in the nearby woods, and with the start of hunting season, i had some real safety concerns to deal with.\\n    - which is to say, it works really, really well.\\n    - i have to color the part of my real hair that is left out to make it match the weave.\\n    - not sure if its really helped with my restless legs which is what it was recommended to me for but it does make my tired legs feel so much better.\\n    - so it really isnt such a bad thing.\\n    - im going to contact the manufacturer, and i really hate having to go through so much hassle , but for what i spent on this thing, i feel obligated to.\\n    - i like it and dont love it because its still not really quiet, the handle vibrates, and it currently costs about $25 more than the classic 76. that said, i do recommend giving these a look.\\n    - it made my hair so soft, like silk, really it is so soft, that i cannot believe it.\\n    - fortunately, i was reading up on it and found out tea tree oil can be really toxic for your dogs however, ive also read it can be very good for your dogs; but i dont want to chance it when there are other things i can use; and my dogs are tiny -- 8 and 10 pounds, so i didnt want to kill them or make them severely ill.\\n    - can you smell me great, i love the way that i smell every time i smell me   really scratch the screen and smell me .\\n    - fits really well.\\n    - make sure to get it really rubbed in well, because it could be streaky.\\n    - i now buy loreal, which is a much nicer formula.\\n    - i couldnt really carry her she is 55 lbs.\\n    - really does work!\\n    - she is either not as smart as i thought, or crafty enough to realize she neednt do any work when i will do it for her.\\n    - i am fortunate to have really great prescription drug benefits, but deplin -- since it is not considered a drug but rather a medical food -- is not covered.\\n    - really, its a fantastic tinted moisturizer not that ive tried many though.\\n    - this one not even 2 hours, ive had better body sprays that last longer and are closer to the real thing.\\n    - but i used the soap and really like it.\\n    - no real issues.\\n    - yep sounds really crazy.but it really works.\\n    - when the babies come, i wont be able to wait that long if im running low.its a good thing i was home because i didnt realize that the vendor would using a shipping agency that required a delivery signature.at a glance, the price is a bit steep, but when you figure in that there is no tax and shipping charges, it balances out.\\n    - this product gave me anxiety when my o2 level started to read below 94% .so i drove inmediately to the drs office just to realize that this piece of crap is bad.\\n    - i really enjoy it and you can definitely feel the workout.\\n    - i didnt even realize it was still there.\\n    - we live in rainy, dark oregon, so the winter months are a real struggle without it.this cod liver oil only has 400 iu of vitamin d per teaspoonful, so i usually take an additional d3 supplement seeking health drops or thorne research tablets to ensure i am getting enough.the ingredients of this norwegian cod liver oil per teaspoon is calorie  45total fat  5 gr.\\n    - i really enjoyed the trained parrots.\\n    - shes not really hard on toys anymore but it is reasonably durable.\\n    - easy to put my little guy in and carry around with him in it.of all i looked at, i think tjis was a really good choice.\\n    - i only needed to apply on my hairline so the &34;thinning&34; from the product was really noticeable from the front.<br /> but i have figured out a way to work around this problem, its to apply the product with a cotton pad, what i do now is squeeze 0.5~1 ml on the corner of a cotton pad, separate my hair to show the scalp, then either rub or pat the cotton pad on the scalp while avoiding getting the product on hair like the way people put gel on their hair, the point is only targeting the scalp and the root of the hair.\\n    - vanilla mint is mush better than the meat flavors and used properly your pets will really like geting their teeth brushed.\\n    - this product must be counterfeit!\\n    - uncertain whether there is a real re formulation of the almay makeup products.\\n    - its not really sticky and smell good, unlike order gel or waxing.\\n    - i was really scared i would be wasting my money   i was really scared i would be wasting my money.\\n    - amazing . this works i rarely write reviews, but this product has really impressed me.\\n    - i was really disappointed with the size.\\n    - the smell is wonderful, but i really couldnt get past the texture and found it weighed down my hair a lot.\\n    - she doesnt like getting her nails done so these clippers make it easier for me.having the stop really helps.\\n    -

the only negative i would say is that the little rabbits have a really loud squeaker inside them.\\n    - i found that the only way to really get it down to their skin really well was to use some electric clippers to shave a small spot on the back of the shoulders/neck area.\\n    - this is more like a real thing, it feels soft to the touch and it does not tangle up too much.<br /><br />the head-cap that comes with it is black, so i purchased a skin color one.\\n    - its really a shame tresemme discontinued this great product.\\n    - my dog never really had a pulling problem but her head is so narrow a collar wasnt going to do the trick.\\n    - i called the company to ask what to do; they said, you could try [which says to me that they really dont know what to do] a presoak in warm water with detergent. that hasnt done any good.\\n    -

the thing is-- it really thickens once you add liquid.\\n    - i received it very quick and really satisfied with everything.\\n    - these air fresheners are not very good, they wear off pretty quickly, still have not found an air freshener that really works.\\n    -

the cart is just the best thing really, it has changed her life in a huge way.\\n    - didnt really realize it was for males when i ordered it.\\n    - ]cons - foul-smell right out of the bag- zero odor control; pine scent does nothing to mask urine or feces- tracks *slightly* less than conventional clay-based litter specifically scoopaway; still need a mat next to the litter box- clumps break apart when scooping, even when being extra gentlei was genuinely looking forward to using this product.\\n    - shes a real puller and the securely sewn-in harness held perfectly.\\n    - to achieve this, we need products that use post consumer paper waste.no, not as soft as kleenex, but does it really matter?\\n    - really tiny and exactly what i needed!\\n    - this water bottle has made it very easy for me to work this habit into my lifestyle!the only negative thing i would have to say about it, is that the opening really should be a little larger.\\n    -

this stuff really works.\\n    - he cant get tangled, and the harness is really secure.\\n    - this is hysterical.really.do not turn polly on when children are around or at your front door on saturday mornings when sweet mormon young men ring the door buzzer.yikes!\\n    -

review for shea butter i used the shea butter to make bath melts and it was really easy to use and was excellent in the bath melts.\\n    - i really wanted to get this product bc i love bright, vibrant colors i really wanted to get this product bc i love bright, vibrant colors.\\n    - i love the bronzer for contouring - while in the pan it looks like it has some sparkle, that doesnt really transfer to the face, so what you see on your cheeks is a matte bronzer which is easy to blend and simply perfect for getting that chiseled look i am fair skinned, so i cannot use this shade as an overall bronzer - i dont like that look anyways, so i have no issues with the darkness of the bronzer.\\n    - nonetheless, we hadnt really used the hodgepodge of natural remdies we had acquired over the years, in part because we didnt feel comfortable we were making the right choice for a given condition and we had no comprehensive source for looking things up.\\n    - this stuff tastes good and gives you a real boost.\\n    - we found out about the magic brush and we really liked them.\\n    - i havent really noticed much of a difference in my stretch marks.\\n    -

my dog really likes this brand only.thanks from lorraine\\n    - the stain stays for hours and is really quite flattering, but theres no moisturizing, so i would recommend applying a balm afterwards, preferably with spf.\\n    - we were also having feeding issues with him.getting him to eat the non-pebble higher protein diet required to stabilize his diabetes was challenging.fortunately, i read somewhere on the internet that if you follow the shot with a treat which seems logical now but with the stress of the situation had not occurred to us yet, they will have less anxiety about the shots and it will enable a positive association to form, making the whole process easier for all concerned.well, finding a protein treat that was enticing to him was a challenge until our local pet shop owner recommended real toppers pure wild salmon treats.\\n    - we have 3 cats and 3 dogs so this brush was really put to the test.\\n    - this loreal super blonde and the new loreal paris creme lightening kit   this loreal super blonde and the new loreal paris creme lightening kit only lighten to a certain point.\\n    - my dog william loved it ,and so did i it kept him busy for a good while.i would reccomend this pet toy highly, especialy if you have a really active puppy .\\n    - they are really good for her too.\\n    - also, there are many discussions here about fake perfumes.\\n    - i was really excited to try it, but when you spray it, it is very misty and there isnt much sunscreen to be applied--and the smell permeates the area--and its not a smell where you think, &34;that smells bad&34; its more of a smell where it smells toxic.\\n    - was in the back of the class and the teacher said someone smells real nice back here.\\n    - its natural and actually foams up really well.\\n    - this thing is a novelty at best, the set up is absurd i cant really notice much of a difference.for the same price you can get a kaloud lotus and it works a hundred times better.\\n    - i really like the greens and blues.\\n    - i do not really believe in the typing of hair 100 percent.\\n    - hey really did reduce the pain in my knees and feet after standing 14 hours for work.\\n    -

he could not really stand up, but he could easily turn himself around, which is what my vet said airlines are looking for.\\n    - it is important to realize that both forms are equally equivalent in efficacy.\\n    - there is a very subtle fragrance -- pleasant, but not really noticeable i dont like strong fragrances, so this is good in my book.<br /><br />one thing to note is that when you close the lid, a little bit of lotion comes out of the top.\\n    - i dont really find it bothersome too much now.\\n    - looks and feels really cheap.\\n    - irritates my skin for some reason this product hurts my skin when i apply it to my face, and leaves it really dry and rough after using it  so i am now stuck with bunches of extra products  -\\n    - i really like the size of this item, but the vibration quit after the first use.\\n    - i was not sure about how it would really work for me but was in need and thought i would give this one a  try as i watched them work on various heads of hair.\\n    - at one point asked my doc if it really worked, said they were grand for teething babies and those with arthritis.\\n    - the bars also bend really easily, so now that hes been pushing on the inside of it, its even more difficult to get it set back up once he gets out.\\n    - it smells really nice but ultimately will not protect you against bed bugs.\\n    - i only have 3 days applying this product and i really like it!\\n    - i lie on it and it gives a really nice stretch to the erectors spinae and paraspinal muscles.i weigh about 180 lbs and am 6 feet tall.\\n    -

was great while it worked  this product really does work.\\n    - im back to buying this leash now, and its inexpensive enough that it doesnt really bother me that its poor quality and has to be replaced every few months.\\n    - the finished results looks professional and it looks really nice on my mantel piece or on a shelf.\\n    - it feels really go to apply on my face and i like to warm it up with my hands before applying on my face.\\n    - of water, and i feel like this flavor is really hard for me to swallow.\\n    - works really the same as the lotion, just easier to apply to the feet.\\n    - works really great sunscreen, the smell is very, very nice i have never had a sunscreen smell so good and it goes on clean and really does the job  i will recommend it \\n    - the scent is not a plus like weakened ivory soap with a dash of cheap lemon scent added; but, at a very small fraction of the typical cost, its a real steal.\\n    - i also am a law enforcement officer i didnt really care if i sweat because i was in a uniform and outside all day, but now im in an office wearing shirts and polos and i couldnt stand the embarrassment of large sweat stains indoors .<br />after reading many of the reviews i decided to give it a try.\\n    - its also adjustable both the arm and the lanyard/collar, so it works really well for me.\\n    - it says color changing but allot of the time the lights are all different colors at the same time, it just looks like a light in the tank and nothing really cool.\\n    - but if you cant do that, this is at least a well made fake.\\n    - ive tried several variations of slimming belts and i thought, instead of velcro, zippers would work really well.\\n    - it is great to use to help relieve any muscle soreness that   really doesnt help break up cellulite pockets.\\n    - my only real complaint is it is very expensive.\\n    - i really wanted to like the fitbit surge, but i have to say that it is a huge waste of money.the watch itself is rather good looking ,but it does not have $250 worth of functionality.the notifications and bluetooth music control system is clunky, glitchy and really quite worthless.i wanted to love the hr functionality, however it is constantly losing signal once you really startto sweat.\\n    - i really like how clean the filter pads leave my water.\\n    - i really think this a waste of money.\\n    - i really think that this product is helping my cat who has been diagnosed with ibs.\\n    - this came really bent.\\n    - you really are alot better.\\n    - i have demoed other chairs, and i really don’t know if the claimed superiority is accurate.\\n    - i dont think the neck area, at least for her body type, is the important measurement when trying to decide on what size to order, since the harness isnt really designed to fit around the neck.\\n    - our cat really lets you know she wants to be fed her natural balance platefulls and complains when our dog gets fed first.\\n    - fake the bottle i received was not sealed.\\n    - its the most advanced for keeping moisture in your hair and i can really tell the difference.\\n    -

for the person that wrote the first review, henna isnt supposed to make your hair a new color unless you are really gray.\\n    - i wanted it to groom maltese, but the blade sizes arent really what i need for a body trim i have found.\\n    - medifast really works!.\\n    - i dont work for any of these groups, i am not a professional oil person and i am getting nothing in exchange for posting the truth except for some fake products that are headed to the trash.\\n    - if i have really dirty laundry i may use seventh generation liquid which isnt as green as this.\\n    - fantastic shave mug im pretty new to de shaving and will confess i did not really understand the purpose of a shave mug or bowl.\\n    - add to this that its make of einkorn, the only non-hybridized wheat left on our planet that im aware of, anyway, and you get a really great tasting food thats extremely healthy.\\n    - it stays really clean and the water is fresh.\\n    - but, it doesnt really sound like a bad thing!\\n    - to see what this is really about and ensure you get unexpired products, go to [ ] and they are shipped directly from the it works warehouse with easy return/exchanges policies.\\n    - the cat realizes whats happening and runs for the bedroom.\\n    - finally i realized i had to take a sterner hand with my diet and ordered the supplies for a high protein liquid diet.\\n    - 18 grams of protein is really good.but.what a messy bar this is to eat!\\n    - it seems crazy, but this stuff really works!\\n    - i must have lost a few hundred bucks in heating / cooling on this thing no really.\\n    - really works!\\n    - it does whiten and i just love the toothpastle it foams up and the mothwash burns worser than really sorry about caps  any way anything!\\n    - the only real problem is there is never enough glue and application tips in it so i would recomend buying the refils that some people sell on amazon.\\n    - to make it perfect, you should really have more colors to chose from, dog lovers will jump on pretty colors for their beloved pets.\\n    - i fed them to my dog anyway and he got really sick.\\n    - also as an added bonus you really get a lot for your money\\n    - ive managed to bend in one somehow but overall theyre really sturdy.\\n    - really great.\\n    - unlike a paper towel, one of these hand towels is enough to really dry your hands and they are soft to the touch.\\n    - its ok. i really love the look, and they are kind of comfortable but i never expected so much padding in them.\\n    - i real like the energy i have gotten.\\n    -   dry skin its thick and lingers & smells really good i have dry skin its thick and lingers & smells really good\\n    - i recently bought it for my mother-in-law for mothers day and she really liked it so a winner!\\n    - after i got it i realized that on the package it says that not for dogs under 6 month old.\\n    - however, as far as whitening goes, i dont really think it works because as soon as you stop using the soap, your skin returns to its previous state.\\n    - i really cant stand when people give a one star review just because their cat turned up his nose to a toy or a bed, because that says nothing about the construction and quality of the item.\\n    - now, of course, real custom orthotics will cost much more, but they are truly a custom product.\\n    - this does not work well if you have really long hair.\\n    - and the price is really good.\\n    - cost more than internet googling prices but the pills are the real thing from a doctor.\\n    - my only real complaint is with the scent.\\n    - im sure most dr.s and scientists will tell you that you need to actually get real testosterone put back into your body some how.\\n    - really disspointed.\\n    - it might seem like an exaggeration, but it is really that bad.\\n    - good, but .. i bought this because my hair on top is getting really thin and losing quite a bit of hair every time i shampoo in the shower.<br />with this product, it seems like im losing less hair loss when shampooing, but it leaves my hair feeling quite coarse.\\n    - perfect little pet waterer - it really does the job .\\n    - the fabric started to wear because of the sun and became really weak and dry.\\n    - really bad texture!\\n    - these brushes are really nice.\\n    - just sized weird, bought for my 4 month old german shepherd and fits real snug.\\n    - i was really excited to receive this, but when .\\n    - one thing for sure, i really dont want to continue taking her to the vet and watch them keep her on antibiotics, steroids, and anti-fungal meds.\\n    - i had bought a similar product at petco that really seemed to help my 4 year old rottweiler.\\n    - its ok it doesnt really exfoliate which is what i was hoping for and the bristles are not long enough to really get the arch area and between the toes, but it still beats bending over and generally gets feet pretty clean.\\n    - it really does the job when it comes to detangling hair.\\n    - its really great for your hair too!!\\n    - this one has a few more red strands then my first, but matches the rest real well.\\n    - not sure if we like hubby seems to go through these quicker than he should, wondering how good they really are, this is the 3rd one we have ordered, might consider new razor\\n    - it also looks really cute on her, so it was exactly what i was looking for.\\n    - really high quality stuff.\\n    - even a shallow bowl, where my first one came from.if it rattles, and/or looks too much like a green toupee, get real moss, that is not packaged, and actually works to remove carbons and keep water much safer for your fish.check out amazon, as i am looking now for a few more to put in a non filtered, weekly changed, 2 gal aquarium with a heater, stones and a nice hiding place for ms. starlite.\\n    - we ordered this system in the spring and really love it.\\n    - i bought this with a green coffee bean extract.i tried just the garcina cambogia by itself at first and it did not seem to really help.\\n    - the matte finish looks great on this lighter, makes the colors on it really pop.\\n    - really nice for newbies, to move them off of &34;the can of goop&34; and on to a much better face feel traditional product.\\n    - great for the skin, a bit too aromatic ive read that barage oil is one of the best oils for facial skin and i was really excited about trying it, but as soon as i opened the bottle i found it the aroma of this particular oil to be too strong for me.\\n    - finally an item that really does what it says it .\\n    - gets really sticky and the warming sensation didnt really help increase the sensitivity\\n    - the packaging was all i liked about this product i was really interested in the product because i have never used an under eye gel.\\n    - i really liked the way the product looked when i received it.\\n    - this conditioner made my hair so soft i ask people to touch it  x this shampoo and condition from nexxus is amazing  let me first say i do not ordinarily buy shampoo that costs $15, i normally buy cheap shampoo and conditioner because after years and years of trying many shampoos and conditioners i never noticed a difference with anything i used really.\\n    - the few weeks before we had seen the dentist, my son, was giving me big fits about brushing his teeth and he would not sit still long enough for me to really clean them well.\\n    - doesnt massage, doesnt keep heat, doesnt really do anything that a tub of hot water couldnt do.\\n    -

somehow, i really dont want my hair smelling like a cheap candle but luckily it doesnt linger for too long.\\n    - i think its too steep here, but i drive right past a target on my way home from work so factoring in gas money doesnt really account for my situation.\\n    - using them, i have been able to see how much damage cheating on my low carb diet really does.\\n    - also, i dont really like the idea of using something once and throwing it out if theres an alternative.\\n    - my wife really wanted a nice pink , but this is more purple.\\n    - really.\\n    - didnt really notice any excessive heat from the coils.\\n    - also, i am told that the real super slim only come from overseas, like china or japan.\\n    - my go to lotion this lotion is really the only one that i use.\\n    -   there really pretty i like them so if u want star on your nails you should by it.\\n    - a really good intensifier i worked at a tanning salon so ive tried a lot of lotions & phoenician is one of my favorite intensifiers.\\n    -

i really enjoyed these honey oat bars but my favorite bars are the chocolate chip clif crunch bars.these pretty much taste like those without the extra goodness of the chocolate chips.\\n    - the plant looks like a fake plant, the thing looks plastic not like a terracotta pot but i expected that since the plants fake and the base is plastic, but it still beats the exposed nasty litter boxes of the past, or the huge ufo looking fully enclosed boxes my cats wouldn’t go near.\\n    - i i thought my cat would rip apart a mouse a day, but it seems to get really attached with two of them.good news  i have a lot of gifts for other cat owners friends.\\n    - that cleared up his food allergy that i realized he had after it had cleared up from the food.\\n    - after using the pads for a little while, my cat realized he could cover up the wet spot by pulling one of the corners over it, but he doesnt cover it 100% of the time.\\n    - they really work.\\n    - it really does work in stopping and preventing side cramps and stitches during exercise i like to run.\\n    - is this the real vet pack.\\n    - other than that i really like these\\n    - the items in this package looks nice, but are very small and the handcuffs are really flimsy.\\n    -

seems to really help my dog\\n    - the whole family uses this and it has really helped keep us from getting sick as often as well as reduced the time we are sick.\\n    - also, when you put these elastic straps it puts a lot of pressure on the neck opening making it really tight for the dog.anyway, i guess i can make my dog use it when it is pouring or some other extreme case but over all i am not thrilled with this purchase.\\n    - i still use a stronger hair spray on my bangs bc there i really need the extra hold.\\n    - hmm honestly beyond the scent i didnt really like it.\\n    - this product has really helped to suppress my cravings, and in 4 months i have shed over 20 pounds.\\n    - i really like it.another thing i noticed, isnt really something you should   i am just clumsy in all that i do.\\n    - this really works well with my grandson in the pool with no accidents so far.\\n    - it really helps tightening my pores and improving my breakouts a lot.\\n    - i was having terrible acid reflux and was miserable for over a month until i realized it was the fish oil i was taking.\\n    - amazing top coat i never really understood the point of a top coat until i used seche vite - the reason being that my previous top coat polishes were worthless!\\n    - i could occasionally get one of them to bat it around and eat some treats out of it, but that really only accomplished her eating more treats than i would normally give her.\\n    - i bought the red and it really it very attractive.\\n    - really dont like it when amazon says five stars means i love .\\n    - this stuff rules, it makes you look nicely tan right after you get out of the bed..but not scary fake tan.\\n    - i really like this product.\\n    - we purchased another one through amazon because the cats really love it and we humans had come to depend on it.\\n    - there really is no smell, no dust and i havent yet noticed any tracking!\\n    - easy to remove, easy to clean, really adds comfort to a long drive.\\n    - youd never know it unless you read it because it is simply a chrome slider not an actual lever that you can easily see.once i move the slider, the water came out full force and all three shower head positions work perfectly.so as a recap, here are the pros and conspros- really nice attractive design.- works well.- hose is metal not plastic.- hose is extra long!\\n    - the divacup didnt really work for me/my anatomy.\\n    - i think it really helped my immune system get back on track.\\n    - this is honestly the first product that i can say it really does work.most times i eat 2 at a time because that is what seems to work best for me.\\n    - i really wanted to use it topically but its a deep brownish yellow like betadine and stains everything near it.\\n    - therefore amazons description is a little confusing.because i just started, i cant give a really good review on it.\\n    - my husband really likes these socks.\\n    - despite this i was still skeptical thinkingtr the real test will be to see how soon my scalp will start itching.\\n    - and then i realized it looked orange in sunlight or fluorescent light, neither of which i had been applying this under, nor looked in a mirror with.\\n    - i still have an occasional spot pimple here and there fine by me, compared to my constant deep rooted spot acne, but this has been the only product that has given me really significant results.\\n    - upon reflection i realize it wasnt nice to enter his safe space with this gunk.\\n    - i just recieved this product and was really excited to use it after reading all the great reviews.\\n    - maybe one day hell realize that he doesnt have to eat so fast that he sometimes chokes.\\n    - really great product i really like this product, does not leave the hair sticky and does what it says it does.\\n\\n\""

there is not much difference in girth size between the xl and 2xl, something to note if you are shopping for a barrel chested dog like my frenchie.\\n    - wrong size.\\n    - bigger size, good quality and better handle.\\n    - it dries to look nearly exactly how it looks in the bottle.\\n    - and believe me i tried - i bought them a canvas one, a kong one, an oversized plastic frisbee, even a $24 stuffed one with squeakies in it that looked a lot like the dogcatcher, but they turned their noses up at all of these.\\n    - the size was very different from the one i expected.\\n    - it came in a package as white rocks, similar in size to my thumb.\\n    - i liked the size and shape of the bag.\\n    - i received a pair of these for christmas, and i loved them, so i scouted on line and found them again, so i could buy a couple of pair to put back when the first pair wear out.besides being purple, they have a great non slip bottom.would definitely buy again.one size fits most, it says.\\n    - for daily use, i now go with simply right super absorbent 23x36 under pads from sams club which is also a very good product, not bad at keeping odor at bay, the size fits replacement crate trays, more room for 2 pups to use and best of all the cheap price tag of $24 for 120 pads and they are sold in-store, no need to order online.\\n    - when using one should wet the hair, apply a small amount to the palm of your hand i use a dime-nickle sized amount, rub your hands together and then apply to your hair and lather it for 1 minute.\\n    - i really like how the dosing is adjustable for any size dog.\\n    - bounty.skinny size?.\\n    - the container you see pictured is the size of a womans compact make up thing, or birth control pill pack.\\n    - cute and a good size, but clearly two pieces pressed together.\\n    - i thought it was the perfect size since i typically buy my cats 16 pound bags of food and with the 28 pound capacity, i could purchase a 25 pound bag if there was a decent priced sale.\\n    - i purchased these to be put into gift bags and they worked very well, convenient packaging, just what i expected.\\n    - i had tried a larger size of the regular yoga toes, and they overstretched my small toes.\\n    - this is my third bottle purchased.\\n    - was sent the wrong size.\\n    - the japanese size is pretty small.\\n    - cute, size was ok. i wish the detail stood out a bit more but the colors were very nice and it suits my chihuahua cause he loves to give and receive lots of kisses.\\n    - you have to use a q-tip to apply; you are not supposed to shake the bottle.\\n    - the jar is abit on the medium small size, but it doesnt take much.\\n    - i received my bottle of phenelite a day earlier than estimated, after two days of takeing them i seem to have more energy and zero side effects .\\n    - the bottle lasts for months, even when used 2-3 times per day.\\n    - well always have a bottle of it on hand from now on.\\n    - the only real discomfort that could come from this is the smaller sizes but if your like me, you dont need them.\\n    - use a spray bottle mixture of vinegar/lemon-grass oil/clove oil/pine tree oil/tea tree oil/water and sprayed the interior foam cushion up and down.\\n    - to shave my legs, i use roughly an almond-size amount for each leg for the entire area from just above the knee on down, and that is plenty of product.\\n    - i couldnt even finish the bottle.\\n    - i know there are two sizes for this and id suggest the bigger one with the 4 holes across.\\n    - its about the same size as it looks in the picture, i really do like it but i can never find anything to wear it with and i wore it in public maybe 4 times.\\n    - works great!<br /><br />ive only rated it 3 stars though, because the company that sent it to me put the wrong lid on the bottle.\\n    - just as importantly, i received excellent customer service regarding uniformity of size.\\n    - perfect size for a puppy or small dog.\\n    - right size, catches any fluid spilt on it and easy to clean up any mess thats get on it.\\n    - the only problem which im not sure if its even avoidable due to the packaging is that i had to tie it in place otherwise it collapses but it isnt problem enough to knock any stars.\\n    - it fits anyone under 30. the bottle is really cute too.\\n    - maybe high-end department stores have some trial sizes, etc.\\n    - lol start a marble size and work your way up over a couple weeks up to a blob a half the size of a golf ball.\\n    - in fact, iis only when he wishes to express displeasure that i hear the wheeking that guinea pigs are known for.of fresh vegetables, leaving sparky with nothing but pellets and dry timothy hay, hes capable of emptying half of the bottle in a single day.\\n    - the bed is just what i expected except for size.\\n    - once i go through with this bottle, i will buy again.<br /><br />i am still using it.\\n    - i have a 55 lb german shepherd named lola, shes quite petite for a german but still a decently sized dog.\\n    - it wasnt clear that there are different sizes inside, so be sure to open the correct size packet for your needs.\\n    - she loves the pocket for holding a small water bottle at night.\\n    - i cant seem to get any out of the bottle and there were no instructions in the box.\\n    - love this perfume was surprise by the bottle size, larger than i expected love this perfume.\\n    - they are made very well , but i cannot use them becsuse the size is a 2. it wasnt specified when i ordered the boots.so , if your fig is s size two.\\n    - by the way these are the larger ones - recommend them over the smaller ones two sizes.\\n    - so unless your a lady with a size 11 shoe or something, you should be ok.i notice though, that little bitty feet will not work with these, they would be too big if your feet are tiny.my shoe size is about a 9. i would think between size 7 and 10 would be good for these slippers.\\n    - my german shepherd/pyrenese mix loves it and its the perfect size for her\\n    - but, for a few pets this bottle is perfect.the only negative thing i can think of is the spring/harness/hanger that comes with the bottle.\\n    - the next one i opened, the safety seal was broken and the inside of the bottle was orange vs. white.\\n    - when the package came in the mail, the bottle was completely red.\\n    - $30+ for one 60ct bottle ?\\n    - other than the size of the seat, this rollator has all the nessesary features   adjustable handles, brakes that lock, 6 wheels, removable backrest and a tote bag for storage.\\n    - i greatly prefer it over standard gel  and the 1.7oz size is perfect for traveling with it in a carry-on bag.\\n    - theyre super light-weight and the perfect size for spices, nuts, seeds, powders, or small amounts of liquids.\\n    - i bought this in the largest size for my lab but my other three dogs keep getting on it including my yorkie.\\n    - im almost through the 180-capsule bottle and one thing i have noticed is i feel more alert and dont seem to hit that 3 00 slump anymore.\\n    - i took my bottle of young living lavender and comapared it to the one in this set, and my nose could not tell a difference.\\n    - i use the bigger one in the downstairs or kitty bathroom for their over-sized litter box, and the smaller paw-print mat beneath their food and water bowls in the kitchen.\\n    - perfect for a medium sized mustache this is great for my medium sized mustache.\\n    - chap stick size fyi im not sure what i was thinking.\\n    - good buy and reveals brighter skin works great but use per the directions on the bottle and be prepared for your skin to look a little flaky and dry for the first few days.\\n    - i didnt want a return for my money or anything, i just wanted to let them know to prevent future instances like mine from happening and they company actually sent me a whole bottle at no cost.\\n    - i bought another slightly cheaper and popular brand about four times here but found inconsistencies in the quality of enteric-coating from one bottle to the next.\\n    - i think its a very mild type of glue but i cant be sure exactly what that sticky stuff is that holds down the flap on the back of the package.overall, you just cant ask for better quality tissues when youre on the go and cant carry a large size box with you!\\n    - they are small enough about the size of a dime to give out frequently without worrying about added calories.\\n    - he has already ordered another bottle.\\n    - it keeps the scent until the bottle is empty!\\n    - 5 for quality, 1 for deceptive packaging.\\n    - that puts her at the top of the range for size 4 in both categories and at the bottom of the range for size 5 for both girth and weight.\\n    - my bigger concern is the packaging though.\\n    - it has great glide, a little goes a long way, and i love not having to deal with loud and annoying pump lotion bottles.\\n    - the box specifies using alcohol presumably rubbing alcohol to disinfect the skin where the derma roller is used and the micro needles of the roller itself, so that is why so much attention is given to the packaging of this product and to providing the clear hard plastic box.\\n    - i went to kmart way back when and bought up every bottle of the old formula citrus they had.\\n    - i just refill the spray bottles from the big jug.i generally warm a disposable wipe from the tap, squeeze it out then spritz it with about 3 squirts of the perineal cleanser.\\n    - they should send out one cap in each size for free so that you can see whats actually going to fit before you buy it and pay shipping for something thats not going to fit.\\n    - i liked this item coming out of the box, it was well-labeled, each pill box just the right size for all my pills.\\n    - my neighbors labrador is average size for her breed, and she fits just fine on it.\\n    - another plus is that it is quite water proof which is a relief since it rains a lot where we live, so the vest wont be soaked when you come home from a rainy day, and neither will be your dog.the service dog patches seem quite good quality and are easily removable and quite visible, they are about 3/4x2 3/4 which unfortunately i didnt know before purchasing, so i bought a wrong sized patch i wanted to use an emotional support dog patch.\\n    - i dampened my hair with a water spray bottle and some moisturizer and thats it.\\n    - i like the non-jittery effect and the handy packaging.\\n    - i am so disappointed in purchasing this product because it worked fine the first week or two but now i have to find a more eco-friendly product that work do this over time.\\n    - i wanted to show off the relative sizes and provide as best as a video can do a comparison of the noise made by the two models.\\n    - perfect size for my little shih tzu.\\n    - it is more painful to use that my more expensive derma rollers, but for 1/2 the cost you are getting what you pay for.<br /><br />the 0.5mm size is good for around eyes and smile lines.\\n    - perfect size & weight.\\n    - i have used my bottle for 2 years and just ordered again.the label and bottle is different, but same name.\\n    - perfect dog water bottle.\\n    - two stars bottle was broken when arrived!\\n    - great item, wrong size  .\\n    - probably an xxl would not fit most 20-lb dogs.i also bought a size xl, for my sisters 12-lb maltese, which fits him pretty well he wears a size small in zack & zoey.the colors are nice and bright.\\n    - the packaging comes in a resealable bag.\\n    - i ended up liking all four of them and am currently waiting for full sizes of the hot pink and gold to arrive.\\n    - very absorbent, large size and well made.\\n    - pleasant surprise when i ordered this, i was expecting only the 3.4 oz bottle.\\n    - this is used by my father at age 90. nothing happens, after using 2 bottles.\\n    - and really over priced for such a small bottle  \\n    - some people dont like that its called marketing i have a question for all you watchdogs does it seem reasonable to you that someone would write a positive review to get a free bottle of a product they really dont like?\\n    - everyone, be sure to inspect your bottles for serial numbers the one on box, usually stamped or written on the bottom should match with the one on the bottle itself.\\n    - these are about the size of a tennis ball, so slightly smaller than the other models of this brand carried at petsmart.\\n    - thankfully we had a old bottle we could use the top off if.\\n    - dogs measurement s were right between sizes and should have gone with the next larger size.\\n    - this bottle is fantastic!\\n    - i opened it and the plastic top on the bottle was coated inside with runny brown tanner, and it had leaked all down the bottle.\\n    - we purchased this crate medium size - listed as 27hx24wx36l from a different online retailer.\\n    - this is a packaging issue though and in no way detracts from the litter.\\n    - as long as you are aware of the size, this is a great purchase.\\n    - obviously one knows what to do with a face cream, but it’s always nice to have guidance on the packaging for a new product, like how much to use, etc.<br /><br />all in all i would recommend this product to people who are happy to pay for an effective and luxurious cream.\\n    - therefore, i buy it in the smaller bottles only.\\n    - great flavor and size.\\n    - because you add a layer daily, it gets thick in the bottle very fast.\\n    - i even bought a second bottle for my boyfriend because he shaves his head completely bald and gets razor burn bad on the back of his neck and it worked the same for him as it did me and now we dont shave without it.\\n    - i did get a free bottle to try.\\n    - the packaging is rather ingeniously designed to slip right onto a towel rack.\\n    - you will have more kit for less weight, size and money.\\n    - just make sure to buy it from here because elsewhere the bottle runs 40-50 bucks.\\n    - i figured i would give it a shot and ordered a couple of bottles of dermanail.\\n    - size is about 17.5 in x 29.5 in\\n    - great for nail designs, the doting sizes are not to different from each other but once you get a hold of the am mount of nail polish you need for each size you will be able to see more difference.\\n    - love this conditioner, on my 2nd bottle my sister gave this to me for christmas.\\n    - poor packaging.\\n    - five stars perfect size for traveling\\n    - i see this product isnt available today which gives me a good reason to see how well a bottle of generic milk of magnesia would work in lieu of this product.\\n    - nice batteries and easy open packaging.\\n    - kleenex scores a goal with this pocket sized pack of 15 two ply facial tissues.\\n    - works great but i needed a bigger bottle and nozzle.\\n    - i assure you that this is completely real the packaging was tightly sealed and the offical box was there too.\\n    - this size is best for really small dogs, but it worked well for us and does not take up much space.\\n    - cuts my medium sized dogs nails with ease.\\n    - same price as before, half the size this is my second time ordering this particular soap, although ive ordered other scents from this brand in the past.\\n    - again, i only used about a dime size so the smell was not too strong.\\n    - dont buy the 3 bottle kit.\\n    - sometimes i have to cut it down to fit my junior-sized shirts which is a little annoying.\\n    - i have a 20lb ragdoll who stays on this everyday.perfect size for him and his brother it is very sturdy.\\n    - capsules were broken inside the bottle when i opened it!\\n    - you do not feel jittery at all and it does give you energy throughout the day and thank you to gloria for sending me a free bottle and your feedback!\\n    - i like the size of the soft gels and its easy .\\n    - its size was bigger than i expected.\\n    - was looking for the same thing that was used in the hospital for help with keeping the baby from making a mess.this was the right size as i need for my changing pad for my little one.i have had many pees and poops on them and they keep it all in and nothing goes out very absorbent!highly recommend for that purpose and any other purpose needed for keeping some messes in.\\n    - perfect size.\\n    - new bag design very hard to unroll and pull apart, size and shape are very small, quality of bags is very poor.\\n    - my hair is shoulder length and i use a little less than a quarter size from the roots to the tips and just shake out the curl.\\n    - i would not accept a bottle of it now if you paid me to take it.\\n    - product good, packaging is meh this product is really good.\\n    - just finished the whole bottle.\\n    - the size was perfect and fit exactly into the wooden hutch i have for them.\\n    - they only made 3000 bottles and most were filled with tiny beads and used as mile markers on the mongolian steppe.\\n    - i bought these after reading the reviews that said they did not leak like other bottles.\\n    - with this bottle you attach the holder and then can adjust the bottle to the needed height.\\n    - i had trouble finding the right size for my expensive stainless steel kitchen 10 gallon garbage can.\\n    - size small fits our 14 lb puppy with room to grow.\\n    - good size.\\n    - in order to make this a fair trial i decided when my bottles were empty i would wait a few weeks to see what happens.\\n    - it is a lot bigger than it appears, if you know what the size of a mouth harp is - thats about the size.\\n    - came on time, no complaints about the packaging.\\n    - i was really disappointed with the size.\\n    - i bought this as a stocking stuffer but will buy a few more as im sure i will misplace it like i do everything else this size.\\n    - it works great, the tote actually helps to insulate the bottle so the water stays cold longer.\\n    - im disappointed with it tho for one <br />-the product had busted and it was all over the inside of the box<br />-looks like they tried to tape it or something but it was just bad packaging on their part.<br />-there wasnt much in there to begin with even my mother noticed.<br />-she has really damaged hair from dyes over the years shes tried everything this just wasnt it.\\n    - i bought this bottle for a song, as part of the add-on program on amazon.\\n    - i purchased a bottle already and noticed a vast difference in my hair, it was healthier, stronger and shinier.\\n    - it doesnt fit a full size truck seat.\\n    - all the better for us because we go through the bottle slower.\\n    - the newer bottle specifies **probiotic 30 billion cfus is stable while refrigerated or stored at room temperature ~70°f.\\n    - the results have been so incredible that i bought a second bottle for my mom.would absolutely recommend, five gold stars!\\n    - im confident the bed will still be big enough for him once hes reached his full adult size.\\n    - love it, but know what your buying i personally love the smell of the anarchy, i think its axes best deodorant but there are 2 types by the same name so after calling axe and having it explained to me, here is the difference<br />one is blue in color and smells a little lighter, and does not say antiperspirant<br />the other is white &34;my favorite&34; and say antiperspirant & smells stronger in my opinion<br />both types are anarchy<br />by the way, if you have the time call the customer service number on the bottle and have them explain it or any other questions, they will send a free coupon for a free product up to a $6 dollar value, i used my right away!\\n    - two nice size zippered pockets for info and/or doggie-bags.\\n    - pkg is what u get size is small and shower proof\\n    - unlike other diet pills i dont feel over caffeinated, shaky, etc, but my cravings & portion sizes decreased a lot and my energy levels were better.\\n    - once synced to the computer a process which is easy, and automatic once set up, you can view how many steps, and how many calories youve burned for specific periods of the day, in 15 minute increments.in this case, size really does matter.\\n    - also i plan to buy another bottle.\\n    - works good, not happy with size of rollers these work really well but there are too many different sizes and not that many of each type.\\n    - for my size 13 feet this unit is not large .\\n    - however, the only time i will need it to roll is when i move it to retrieve other pet items behind it, which isnt a major ordeal.all in all, i would recommend this container because of the size, added bonuses, color, and overall price.\\n    - runs small im usually a size medium top and i ordered a large so it would be loose but when it came i could barely even put it on.\\n    - the size small fit my 45 pound dog perfect.\\n    - this product is a yellowish gel, that has a sickly-sweet melon and cucumber scent, and the back of the bottle is all in arabic.\\n    - the size is perfect for a medium sized cat.\\n    - i will continue another month with my free bottle they will give me.\\n    - i have lost a whole dress size and working on the next.\\n    - we also can not have her sleep in these at night as they are prone to leak if shes in them for over 6 hours - a problem that has been alleviated by placing her in huggies pure & natural size 2 at night.\\n    - the cat is medium size and a stray.i would have returned it but i got sick and i think i’m past the date of returning.i made my own feeding station with a large clear tote turned on its side against the wind and held down by bricks i happened to have.it seems sturdy enough.\\n    - my other water bottles worked fine.\\n    - just look at this prices for the size of the bottle.\\n    - i do not notice the formula being any different from when it was in the old packaging.\\n    - i am only giving it 4 stars because i wish that it came in a bigger size so it lasted longer.\\n    - it trims them down to two different sizes with the two included comb attachments and is also good for trimming any stray hairs around the eyebrows.\\n    - perfect size for travel and waterproof.\\n    - the key is only use a small dime size amount.\\n    - my mask love the mask and love that it is not messy at all , gos on my face fine and washed off easy also pretty good size and amount in the bottle\\n    - anyways, its the perfect size for 4 rats maximum.\\n    - will also mention that the product seemed exceptionally packaged in its original packaging.\\n    - the supplements included instructions on how to get a free bottle of the same product.\\n    - good size bites for his small mouth.\\n    - the large holds three medium-sized adult females with room to spare.\\n    - it is a good size for 3 cats and not require a lot of attention.\\n    - good size for my pomeranian.\\n    - sizes which are sufficient to allow noticeable results from use.\\n    - however, it does not shrink the size of my pimple , but will slightly reduce the redness and help remove left over dirt.<br /><br />overall its a 4/5 for softness and face texture after use.\\n    - the packaging for each condom is very reassuring.\\n    - the first time i used it, i used only a quarter-sized amount of the shampoo twice, and i still had my dandruff.\\n    - im crediting the cages size with the reduced seeds on the floor.\\n    - perfect for dressy occasion just the right size.\\n    - i used an entire bottle on a roughly 3 circumference stain.\\n    - ive tried using each product separately with other brands but it doesnt give me the same feeling gonna buy the fullsize shampoo & conditioner now!\\n    - i still try to run at the coolest time possible but on the weekends on long runs its nice to not have to get up at 4am.you do still have to pay attention to your dog and keep the jacket wet if youre out for a while but bringing an extra chilled bottle of water while out is a small price to pay to have a very happy pup.on a side note i see a few posts on here about people worried about their little buddys paws.\\n    - i dont know if i received a defunct bottle or what, but i wont be ordering from this company again.\\n    - my fiance was pleased i had a doubt that the perfume is a counterfeit product because i have seen a lot of perfumes which are bottled and packed exactly the same but are fake.\\n    - i put this on my head when i feel a migraine about to rear its ugly head, and this icy cold magic in a bottle can take a 9 to a 5 on a pain scale.\\n    - i use a 16 or more ounce bottle.\\n    - she’s always trying to find nice natural creams that she can wear during the day under her makeup and many are either too greasy or makeup curdles with it.<br /><br />i like the simple and elegant packaging.\\n    - im not a fan of that.<br /><br />the packaging also leaves something to be desired.\\n    - it is great for high heat situations and equally as good ride on the bottle, as lucille ball would say its tasty too as in vetivitiveggimin.\\n    - the compact size is ingenious while still giving consumers 15 white two ply tissues to use so theyre never without a tissue if they need to clean anything or blow their nose.the first time i showed this pocket pack to a friend of mine she thought it was some sort of joke because she couldnt figure out how to open it!\\n    - the bottle of product just 20-30% full  disappointed about saller who was taking care of this package\\n    - very colorful decoration, nice size.\\n    - they fit my toddler really well and the size 4 diapers have never leaked on us.\\n    - because i sleep with my hands by my face, this puts me into dream land very quickly.i had difficulty getting the oil out of the bottle, but the solution to that is that the top will come off with a knife, run hot water over the top, and pop it back on.this essential oil blend is 90% jojoba and 10% chamomile oil, but it is still very strong and works well.on another note, i had a problem with this company and this specific purchase, and the company fixed it and made it right.\\n    - for the price you cant beat the coverage size, and our pup has taken to it without incident.\\n    - after he died, i found out that no water came out of the bottle after one or two drinks.\\n    - plus they send you a free bottle after you receive your first bottle.\\n    - i inhale directly from the bottle the aroma of this frankincense.\\n    - my only complaint is that they are actually business card size, which is really too small for all the information contained.\\n    - i finally bought the big bottle at target 9 bucks and within a week of using it day and night my skin is actually an even tone.\\n    - im halfway thru the bottle & ive not lost anything, im hopeful its gonna kick in soon.\\n    - we selected that size based on estimated adult size of our new puppy.\\n    - not only will you learn how to use it properly, and find you could have been using far less, but its also quite entertaining.i bought my first bottle probably 30-something years ago.\\n    - of course it depends on the size of the dog you are walking.\\n    - it just promises to make it appear thicker/fuller-- which it absolutely does!<br /><br />pro <br />the smell is nice and mild, imo.<br />makes hair soft and silky<br />when hair dries you can noticibly see that it appears to be fuller and thicker<br />bottles look small but  last long<br /><br />con <br />makes my hair a bit frizzy i guess thats from the volume that its adding or a side effect of sorts from the fulling effect?<br /> i would definitely recommed this product as well as the conditioner.<br /><br />**fyi** - buy at walmart for under $6!<br />just thought i should mention, i bought the keratin oil pink bottle shampoo and conditioner as well because i noticed my hair was breaking when i combed it.\\n    - these stickers were great for a nice look without a lot of work.<br />they stick well and i like having the different sizes.\\n    - 1. adjust smaller serving sizes using the pillow technique found in another review - worked well!\\n    - ordering another bottle.\\n    - though the previous reviewer said the collar was too large, i believe she simply ordered the smallest size without looking at the description or measuring her dogs neck-- the collar is actually much smaller than the amazon description states.size  w-2.0 cm x l-35 cm extends till 45 cm.this means that the collar should be over 17 inches which is admittedly huge for a small collar.the collar i received has a maximum extended length of 35cm, and barely fits my border collie mix who wears a 14.5 collar.im very frustrated by the sizing problems, but the collar works and appears to be fairly well made.\\n    - i like the size and the feel of the silicone is great, but it leaks and i had to use waterline tape plumbers know what i mean to stop the leak.\\n    - not sized.\\n    - it says to dilute it with water but i just apply it directly from the bottle.\\n    - just the right size to carry on a walk for that needed water break thats all i have to say but they wont take my review un less its over 20 words long but theyre asking for my feedback\\n    - it is conveniently labeled on the back of the bottle so that when you see it in the store, you feel like you are buying more.\\n    - so this was a great size for her.\\n    - my only complaint is the bottle- wide and flat and guaranteed to fall over for no good reason.\\n    - good product, and i will be receiving my free bottle.\\n    - i cannot belief these sizes.\\n    - however after playing with the bottle for a while i decided to stab it with a pen.\\n    - another feature is you are cleaning both sides of the lens at the same time, and area these cover is perfect for a lens of any size.\\n    - trying a new supplement company and after reading the ingredients in these blends orders were placed for several different trial sizes.\\n    - these patches/dots come in 2 sizes, which is nice, but they are much thicker and do not blend in with the surface of your skin, so you cant blend in the patch with makeup to make it less visible.\\n    - on this specific jumbo size, it works well.\\n    - im glad i bought the trial size because the two products arent worth the money.\\n    - great product but should of got a size smaller.\\n    - this spray does not have anything questionable--just some juices and natural flavors, along with stevia to make it tasty.you can take this bottle with you wherever you go, as long as you keep it cool and dry, so it does not lose its potency.\\n    -

the gate was the perfect size for a nine pound puppy.\\n    - wish there was a curved clip for the bangs in a smaller size too.\\n    - while i would be okay with shrinking maybe half a size in clothes, im not at all overweight 59 size 8, i dont do diets, make bad food choices etc.\\n    -

i have bought a bottle for myself to see if it will help me with the pain in my knees beginning arthritis and my baldness it runs in the family.\\n    - the razors were already opened and it looks like the packaging on one of the razor blades was opened as well .\\n    -

great for the skin, a bit too aromatic ive read that barage oil is one of the best oils for facial skin and i was really excited about trying it, but as soon as i opened the bottle i found it the aroma of this particular oil to be too strong for me.\\n    - its like they realized that people are purchasing it for the hope that it will help as an anti-angiogenic medication for cancer treatment and now feel as if they can shaft everyone.the price has gone up $40/bottle over the course of 3 months.\\n    - however, the size of the opening cut into the actual door for the classic model i have is larger than the one required for the new model for the large sized flap.\\n    - my 11-year old female golden retriever loves bottles.\\n    - pretty color & packaging, but i need a longer lasting lipstick.\\n    - the next time i used the shampoo, i used more than half a dollar-sized amount, nothing.\\n    - in other words, the packaging was not as pictured.\\n    -

ive had experience with pet naturals dry hip & joint tablets like this  [[asin b0015quuda pet naturals hip & joint tablets, extra strength, 120-count bottle]] which did a miraculous job healing a collapsing trachea for our elderly pomeranian, and thought id give these a try and see if it could help our new girl feel a little better.to my amazement, after just about 3 weeks of 2 of these a day, shes feeling like a puppy.\\n    -

these have never leaked for me.prosquietwide top for easy cleaning and adding icepsycho bunny proofcan be mounted outside the cagedoes not leakeasy to fillheight is easy to adjustconsits plasticwould be difficult to install in a glass tankthe plastic holder could be sturdier, it might break if bottle is forced into it\\n    - pros  the size is perfect for our narrow tub, the feet easily adjust, has a lower rack for soaps and shampoos if needed, seems quite sturdy.cons  the seat doesnt twist as easily as id like it to.\\n    - the watchis too bulky in the middle to be worn comfortably at night.i would also like to say that fitibits customer service has been horrible with trying to address some of my concerns.i had planned on giving them the benefit of the doubt and seeing if the xl size would alleviate some of theproblems with hr acquisition, but the xl is on some horribly long back order.\\n    - the entire unit is also a nice size.\\n    - nice stuff, obnoxious bottle this is a great, refreshing, nondrying shower gel and it immediately became a favorite.\\n    - the shade looks so much darker in the bottle, but is really just shimmery, almost shear.\\n    - scotch tape over the lid is a quick fix though, and many of the more expensive hamster balls look identical to this one, so i dont think that they are necessarily more secure.other than that, its a good size for dwarf hamsters and maybe small mice?\\n    - i am very upset that i spent $40 on a bottle of lotion that will just get tossed away.\\n    - good size for my green cheeked conure\\n    - this bed fits her okay, but i would recommend one size up for a dog that size.the material is a nice tough, durable material.\\n    -

it really fits full sized cats and has a place for water and food also very open a nice carrier for my kitten.\\n    - also, the packaging was a bit concerning at first.\\n    - i received a refill bottle with no box and no pump, just plastic wrap.\\n    - my cat wont use traditional sized hooded litter boxes.\\n    - the only negative is the glass bottle plastic is better for travel and for those of us that have tile flooring.\\n    - size, i checked out amazon.\\n    - its very good at curbing your appetitei know there are some bad reviews about this product and im sorry it didnt work for those people but ive gone from a size 12 to a size 8 in one month without exercising.\\n    - they are not dwarfs and i did not want to purchase the dwarf size habitrail, knowing they would grow.\\n    - if i eat just one, it isnt as bad, but when i eat 2 i definitely need a bottle of water.\\n    - unfortunately, this is one that chips pretty easily but for the size it is worth it, just gotta watch her while she chews!\\n    - the vest is lightweight, and sturdy, and seems to sit quite comfortably on my tiny cocker spaniel.i was a bit thrown off by the many customer reviews that claimed that the vest was too small, so i purchased a size m 21 - 27, for my 20lb cocker who is exactly 22 chest girth.\\n    - one bottle lasts me a year.\\n    - i think they need to redo the one size fits all and make one with small elastic bands.\\n    - lots of different screw sizes within for the various components of a set of glasses.\\n    - terrible smell from plastic packaging!.\\n    - i take it for a rather complicated medical-condition, and from the blood-work done before and after taking it after about two weeks, it does appear to be something that has made a marvelous improvement, but when taken in large doses, care must be given because it does seem to have the detriment of affecting blood-clotting, and when taken in very large doses, seem to be counter-productive.i am very satisfied with everything about this product, from the very reasonable price to the standardized polysaccaride-content, to the capsule size, itself.thank you, now foods, for marketing this product for those of us whom really need it.lindsey\\n    - i part my hair in the middle after a  shower and then apply about a nickle size to each side.\\n    - does the job, but a part was cracked when i got it and it only comes with one attachment for hose sizes.\\n    - i can also fit a good sized blanket in it for him.\\n    - i expected it to be an average size but it is very large.\\n    - after opening the 1st bottle, my husband and i could smell the krill oil.\\n    - the packaging is nice, the spray volume more than adequate, and the product goes on easily and well.<br /><br />my only quibble with the product is the smell.\\n    - i love these liter sizes, because they last months even for long hair and are a better value than the regular bottle sizes.\\n    - everyone has different effects to different powders so i would say try a sample size or something close to it and compare versus your old powder.\\n    - i think it was effective at low strength; that is, if the bottle says &34;use for 5-10 baths,&34; id use 10% of the bottle each time.\\n    - if you liked self absorbed, then the equivalent replacement would be urban antidotes recovery blue bottle.\\n    - i buy my products iin gift sets from salons since its cheaper and a im a student .. but i have had the same bottle for six months and im not even half way through it ..i only flat iron my hair once a week  its well worth a try and money.\\n    - i have used it with several different sized irons and it works well with most.<br /><br />the one small minus is that it barely fits the 2 curling iron that i use most often.\\n    - on my 2nd bottle, very happy with the results.\\n    - and this is a great price for one bottle.\\n    - i have an amstaff pitbull and the 42 x 26 size fits her perfect.\\n    - i ordered these, like im sure most people do, because of the specific size of the condom.\\n    - you can vary the size of the dot by changing the amount of pressure you apply with even the biggest tool.\\n    - great shampoo pump this works perfectly for the 33.8 oz shampoo bottle but would not fit the conditioner bottle.\\n    - i just wished it was a better way to open the bottles.\\n    - does not say you cannot return it on the order page anywhere.how is this a hazarodous material?this is something you can pour down the drain and recycle the bottle.for safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to amazon.com.\\n    - the bottle is empty and i did not even loose 1lb.\\n    - i purchased the small because that is the size my 7lb chihuahua usually wears well the shirt came tiny.\\n    - followed the instructions on the bottle, and within minutes after she consumed a portion of wet cat food with bm tone-up, she produced a liquid bowel movement the size of a dinner plate.\\n    - after 1 1/2 weeks of using this water bottle, my guinea pig died of dehydration.\\n    - i have a standard size bathtub with a showerdoor and this fit perfectly fine.\\n    - my bottle has veggie based cellulose capsules, with the national institute of health and others advising that studies bear out that veggie caps are the ideal medium for capsule use in freeze dried antibiotics.\\n    - two out of the 6 bottles the polish was thick and gummy and looked previously used!\\n    - i just wish they were standard size like eyeliner pencils.\\n    - i like the purple color better than the pink i ordered the pink originally but the sizes didnt fit.\\n    - even the best products are not for everyone, all the time.my bottle arrived as a sample for review.\\n    - for the size of these i wish they lasted longer.\\n    - my sister, whom received it as a stocking stuffer loved the color and its small size.\\n    - while i do not use the metal bottom or guard, i think both features work very well on a pan of this size unlike the smaller litter pans in which neither the guard nor the great are all that practical or effective.\\n    - going off the first bottle i had, that shampoo is good & smells great.\\n    - maybe they should make different sizes, not all seat are the same.\\n    - i feel that a placebo effect would explain the significant decrease in muscle soreness that i expected but would not explain the surprising post workout pump and growth which i did not expect at all.i know there are pricy packaged pre/post workout cocktails out there but i like measuring out the exact amounts of the materials i want that are appropriate to my size, diet, timing and regimen.\\n    - great size.\\n    - the bottle i purchased said it was great for legs, body, bikini area, etc.\\n    - thankfully i bought several large bottles of the old formula!\\n    - beds this size are not cheap and usually only last aprox 9 months before theyre worn out and need re-stuffing or to be tossed.\\n    - great packaging in a locking bucket easy to feed.\\n    - the perfect size for a challenge.\\n    - to small for a pocket comb nice looking, but much smaller than a standard size comb.\\n    - i also like the size, not too big and not too small.\\n    - very, very disappointed that about half of a bottle had liked into the plastic bag and out into the card board box.\\n    - its an awesome shirt a little smaller than what it says so i would go with size bigger especially if you plan on washing and drying it often i would probably go maybe two sizes bigger but its awesome shirt fits my pit just wish i would have just got a bigger size because i do wash and dry\\n    - [[videoid moshujkezsck12]]esmé loves this ball, but for her size 6 month old, 35lb collie puppy, she can become pretty destructive having this ball flying all over the house.\\n    - i love it this make palette comes in a small size fits perfect in your make up bag i recommended to any pretty girl like me\\n    - i had to take the cushion out and replace it with a blanket, though, because shes a little bigger than the size of dog this bed is intended for and she would always scrunch the cushion up going inside.\\n    - perfect for my medium sized cat and covers the liter .\\n    - the bar size is more compressed smaller in length and wider than those i previously received.\\n    - i ordered this size this time.\\n    - this is my first time trying a chemical peel.<br />i consider myself someone with a sensitive acne-prone skin however the instructions say not to use this on sensitive skin.<br />meaning i often have a burning/red/breakout reaction to cosmetics, even the well-known ones for sensitive skin.<br />av&egrave;ne, la roche-posay, louis widmer, etc..<br /><br />packaging<br />the bottle is packed in a bubble-wrap, then in a very sturdy little box.<br />a small card of skin beauty solutions, a plastic bag with gauze pads and instructions are also provided.<br />it was delivered to me, a location in europe, in 8 business days.<br /><br />effect<br />i first did a patch test on my neck.\\n    - the packaging is so elegant it feels like a priceless gem.\\n    - who really cares about a bottle they are going to throw away when empty?!?\\n    - from the picture i thought this would be a good pocket comb, but the size only about half a standard pocket comb makes it more of a mustache and beard comb.\\n    - the bottle itself has plastic raised rings that the holder slides between.\\n    - thanks for the great product and the free bottle for writing this review, i will order again\\n    - waited until i had used the entire bottle before writing this review and was expecting to be disappointed but was not.\\n    - the medium is a nice size for our six month old borador now, but i bet ill be ordering the large sometime soon!\\n    - i wanted it to groom maltese, but the blade sizes arent really what i need for a body trim i have found.\\n    - im giving it 5 stars for its ease of use, packaging and timely delivery.\\n    - not sure if it made his size any different, as he moved fast, so a+ on his part performing better.\\n    - i also love the fact that this tool can wave a good size amount of hair at one time.\\n    - my skin care regimen consists of a st. ives exfoliating scrub a couple times a week, wash with niapads every night, and niaserum as a moisturizer after i wash. this is a wonderful product, and i do not find it too sticky or have an undesirable texture.the spray bottle container was weird for me at first, but if you close your eyes and spritz a couple sprays on you will be fine and it wont run i think this is the best way to apply.\\n    - it took a couple of returns, but the small size in this jacket finally fits my 5.3 pound chihuahua perfectly!\\n    - they are the perfect size for him.\\n    - i just recently purchased this dogloo for my medium sized dog.\\n    - great product,  i love it the only bad thing is that a hair came in one of the glitter bottles but other than that it is awesome  \\n    - adjustable and true to size.\\n    - when it gets to a 1-1/2 inch size, i puff it in the microwave for about 1 minute to make it safe for her to finish.\\n    - use milk thistle for at least 2 weeks prior  to your starting day this helps balance your hormones and prepare for  the herbs youre about to start taking and take more than suggested dosage i used bustmaxx  and actually got it to work pretty fast by taking 3x what the bottle said.\\n    - hope in a bottle?\\n    - some reviewers said it wouldnt fit the big 40 oz bottle but it fits just fine.\\n    - the jel-lee material is very stretchy to accommodate your size, and the inner ribs feel very good.\\n    - each bottle that i have holds 1qt 1.8fl oz, that is 1 quart + 1.8 ounces or 1 liter.\\n    - the pad itself is about 24 long and 6-8 wide.quite large.the yellow pads are the same size, only thinner.hope this helps everyone.\\n    - my only problem with this is the packaging.\\n    - perhaps because of the smaller size, the dogs have been very hard on this, but it is one of their favorite toys, and they will try and steal it for one another on a regular basis.\\n    - perfect size for my chihuahua.\\n    - if it doesnt you are out a few dollars and no worse off-it is easily applied.-the dog does not chew up the bottle itselfcons -the other dog licks the first dog without hesitation leading me to believe the latter dog is broken or bitter spray just doesnt work on every animal.-it does not last indefinitely, we have to reapply whenever our dog is left alone or he starts chewing on himself immediately.-we have no way of knowing if it stings when coming in contact with scratches or irritations.\\n    - recommend using one bottle just for it though very hard to get it out of the bottle.\\n    - i thought that a perfume should live as long as you have some in your bottle.\\n    - they are a nice small size for smaller dogs.\\n    - they taste great and i find myself drinking more water during the day when i have a bottle in my pocket.\\n    - this is a massive bottles that lasts several months of daily washes.\\n    - improved acne i got a small bottle of this as a trial from bare minerals.\\n    - this is pretty bold, i cant believe the person who tampered with this would think that no one would notice this as there are rubber bits hanging off the bottom of the bottle.\\n    - im afraid that if i had gotten the next size larger though, it would have been baggy on her and she would have gotten a foot caught in it or something.\\n    - this bottle is fantastic!\\n    - before i finished one bottle, others could even notice a reduction of fine lines!\\n    - im going to cut the dosage in half and finish the bottle.\\n    - miracle in a bottle.\\n    - the size of the system kit is perfect to try these products.\\n    - you should be aware of the size before buying.\\n    - im on my 3rd bottle and my knee pain has been almost completely removed.\\n    - i received the product in two days which is great, the bottle was really small but i expected that, it smelt really good.\\n    - three stars love the variety of colors packaging sucked it was broke when i got it\\n    - it smells like they dumped an economy-sized bottle of grandmas heaviest and gaudiest perfume into the mixture.\\n    - the packaging is way too big, even for the smaller packets inside.\\n    - adheres well to tables of differents sizes.\\n    - i ordered three bottles to hold me over while i look for other brands so when i run out, i have a backup plan.<br />great product.\\n    - it performs well and was jus the right size.\\n    - it is more pendant size than charm bracelet size in my opinion.\\n    - surprise was how long a bottle lasts as you only use a drop at a time.\\n    - get the smaller size which i also have.\\n    - mixes easily with water just by shaking the bottle.\\n    - nice size for household use.\\n    - size a bit big and the packing is shabby.\\n    - was the right size for the dog crate, better then throwing it out, works like new.\\n    - these are a nice size for small to medium sized dogs.\\n    - cleaning up after accidents is much quicker, easier, and less stinky.the big gallon jug is more economical than the smaller spray bottles we had been purchasing.\\n    - the size is awkward  too big for a lot of spaces, but not big enough to give cats a chance to release the litter before stepping on to the floor.the cats claws have have torn up the material, so it looks kinda bad, but only if you get within a few feet.all in all, not worth it.\\n    - i wish they came in a bigger size.\\n    - i love it  i just ordered another bottle!\\n    - packaging love the brush.\\n    - maintenance the packaging doesnt really say much about how to clean it, but it appears to just need a straight-forward rinsing out with water.\\n    - i am sending back all 3 bottles for a refund.\\n    - i got two different sizes and found that the smaller one is too small, the larger too big.\\n    - i have the medium sizes for my cat.\\n    - and, its in a huge bottle, compared to the other sizes ive received from companies selling essential oils.\\n    - tried the clicker, tried a whistle, tried a bell, tried a squirt water bottle, tried a handheld horn, citronella collar.\\n    - even the size & packaging is well put together too.\\n    - the description did not provide the size.\\n    - i plan to continue using this product, nature wise has even graciously sent me a free bottle!\\n    - these are the original type of toothbrushes that come with the sonicare same size, and brushtype.<br /><br />these brushes are very good, however because of the fast brushing, and when using it together with the uv-bacteria killing bulb, the blue lines on the brush fade quite fast blue hairs that become white are an indicator of changing the brush.<br /><br />if you ask me, the brush is perfect, not too hard, not too soft, brushes well between the teeth.<br /><br />however at the rate that brushes need to be replaced, and considering their size, they should sell them for half the price.<br />i still think $10/brush is a ripoff \\n    - was not the right size\\n    - with the appropriate thinner, a bottle lasts several weeks.<br />3.\\n    - i guess ill have to try the jumbo size so that he cant reach all the food at once.\\n    - good to find some in the regular packaging until we find out what almay really did to their makeup products.\\n    - i recommend these to everyone just pick one size bigger if your pup is furry.\\n    - it had a couple of paws size slots in the side to display the product that were smaller than the toy balls and my cats have about beaten it to pulp playing with it and trying to get them out, so i was looking for a similar toy with sturdier, more durable materials.my cats can not get the toys out of my homemade one, and that is what keeps them fascinated with it.\\n    - i am giving this for christmas and   very nice packaging!\\n    - there were a few spots that needed treatment so the bottle ran out quickly.\\n    - my original purchase last october 2012, the bottle worked fine.\\n    - ive used the recommended serving size for their water dish, and they drink water as frequently as they did before and there dont seem to be any issues.\\n    - it was the size i needed and could not find in a retail store.\\n    - i initially bought this about five six years ago when the female rabbit i had then took to ripping off the metal sipper part of every water bottle i tried.\\n    - please be aware that you are buying 2 bottles when you order this.\\n    - however, it was advertised as the size that will hold 25+ lbs of dog food, and this is absolutely not true.\\n    - im disappointed pleasant barbershop bay rum, coffee, and vanilla notes sniffing the bottle but the scent fades 30 seconds after application.\\n    - ive ordered it for her about a half dozen times now and im about to order another bottle.\\n    - i bought the 48 x 30 x33 crate to safely contain dogs of all sizes for when i need to go to the store or out to dinner or something while im boarding.i had one of those metal playpens standing sides but no roof or bottom that you could set-up into different sizes.\\n    - this will work with a full-size bed if you tighten the wrist/ankle connector straps.\\n    - useless.i bought a whole bottle to have on supply for a potential mishap, and one involving my a88hole cat peeing on my brand new couch has occurred.its been 4 heavy applications over a weeks time - [@] a month in & my cushion still stinks.1.\\n    - great tasting powder and easily mixes with water in a regular water bottle.\\n    - i use this for my smaller dogs and just cut down the size, you will receive a cheat sheet to show you how much to use per poundage of your pet.\\n    - this razor replaced my parker 22r because it can reach the hard to get ares like right under my nose whereas the parkes head size and angle didnt allow the blade to reach that area.\\n    - this shirt is a must have for tea cup size doggies lol\\n    - finally found the perfect water bottle!\\n    - a medium sized dog that is not an aggressive chewer would be the perfect candidate for this toy.\\n    - this site doesnt show different sizes.\\n    - regardless of size changes, the taste is what matters and it is decidedly inferior to what it has been.\\n    - 2 slightly larger holes 3 possibly make the box slightly larger 4 or keep current size but get rid of that lip popping up at the bottom of the opening so they can lay half in and half out.typically i dont take points off because they dont play with a toy, as i know that other cats probably would.\\n    - she emailed me back in a timely manner and informed me to leave my feedback, email her back with a link to my feedback, and i would be given a free bottle of whatever of their products i wanted regardless of good/bad feedback.\\n    - holds different sizes of lipstick tubes perfectly!\\n    - i have long wavy hair that becomes very frizzy during the spring/summer months and this really keeps it under control for a day until the next wash. now, i use way more that a pea size.\\n    - size is smaller than what is pictured.\\n    - i followed the guide on line for size and fit and it was just the size i needed.\\n    - love this fragrance the roller bottle is a perfect way to experience a high-end fragrance at an affordable price.\\n    - i would recommend the next size up if your pet is any larger than that, though!\\n    - it heats up super fast and is the perfect size!\\n    - and yes, you must read the bottle of every essential oil because the labels can sometimes be intentionally misleading.\\n    -

i couldnt detect any fish scent unless i put my nose inside the bottle.\\n    - you have two loading options, with the top being a great option for skittish or ill animals, the size 24.05 x 16.76 x 14.5 is great for either my regular or my larger cat, or a small dog, and its easy to take apart and clean should an accident happen.we love our other petmate carriers, but we are donating them to a shelter to replace them both with this model.\\n    - i did notice, though, that the pump stopped working about halfway through the bottle.\\n    - so after the first bottle, i had to order more - 2!!!\\n    - im not all the way finish with the bottle but i have notice a change in my size.\\n    - these non-folding, absorbent, adequately-sized pads are comfortable.\\n    - i was suprised by the size of this sponge-it was huge, though i have small hands, the outside shape is exactly to hold with comfort, inside part is softer-great for the skin, and outside-to scrub the feet.\\n    - fantastic product poor packaging its the same i.c.e.\\n    - be sure to take a sip from your water bottle before you put these in.\\n    - they are always thiick clean and come in nice packaging i have four dogs and they all love them.\\n    - i liked it so i put the bottle next to the sink and now use it after each dish wash/hand wash. my hands are so soft!!\\n    - it fits, but its almost at the smallest size i can make it and still seems to be a bit on the big side.\\n    - good size, fast shipping\\n    - i also agree with the previous person  people think this is the one with spf just because it comes in the same bottle.\\n    - pouch lasts a for about 1.5 months in a 30 gallon tank with three 5 goldfish.used in conjunction with an marineland emperor 280 and rite- size e filter cartridges.\\n    - i didnt find out these ear plugs come in different sizes until after i ordered.\\n    - the bottle alone looked difficult to manage in our cold winters so i also purchased the thirsty tote.\\n    - nice size   good quality nice size  good quality\\n    - i purchased the green one, and the color doesnt come up as dark as the color of the bottle, but i didnt expect it too.\\n    - i cant tell the difference after one bottle.\\n    - i love the packaging because they stay moist.\\n    - one of my cats threw up daily, the other every once in a while.switched to science diet which is only a little more for about the same size bag, the cats stopped puking within a couple days, they had more energy, seemed happier.and the bag has lasted 3 1/2 months and it will last us a total of 4 months when we finish this bag up.pro plan makes my cats act/seem just like the cheap cat food.\\n    - they sand me small size.and i cant be bothered sand it back,so i got stock with it.\\n    - great bed -waay to much packaging!.\\n    - the squirrels are perfect sized for him i lordered the large size in the option field he loves to pull them out of the squirrels house.\\n    - i had to take it away from after about 10 minutes because i was afraid eating all the fur she was pulling out would make her sick.i am packaging up this toy to return.i think the manufacturer should take invincible out of the name or improve the product.\\n    - well after seeing no results from this bottle i have come to the conclusion it is a fake!\\n    - it is a nice size and pretty durable considering two dogs are chewing on it.\\n    - ive heard of other products having bad packaging, but when my came in they were each individually wrapped, placed in their own box, and then both boxes were placed in a large box with wrapping.\\n    - it came in a plastic packaging and also a little blue gift bag with some tissue.\\n    - tnx i made the photo of my old 4 years sponge and the new one i just received today, they are very strong and last long, i like even smaller size\\n    - the biggest overall downside for me was the size of the head.\\n    - one pump is enough for the face as well as the hair after i shower im half way done with the bottle\\n    - i have two medium sized dogs.\\n    - it was perfect, both of these are still working fine.the bottle is pricey $25.99 when i purchased it compared to typical ball bearing water bottles, if you have a rabbitry with many animals, this might not be the way to go.\\n    - i guess they thought no one would notice the foreign shampoo in the same bottle.\\n    - great price, packaging, and product.\\n    - my sons boxer really loves her new bowls she is a large breed, so we got the largest size which is just perfect for her.\\n    - i think had i put these together, i would have made them fold over to make the business card size, doubling the space for information, enabling the reading of the material much easier.\\n    - excellent results.it does what it says.will order another bottle soon.\\n    - order a size big.\\n    - they love the size--can grab it and flip it--and rub all over the little succulent fishies!\\n    - perfect for my medium sized cat and covers the liter nicely so you can keep out the smell and not stare at it when walking by.\\n    - it takes up less room than the bottle of alcohol did on their benches and they all love them.\\n    - each morning i took the minute to apply the liquid to my nail bed and left a bottle on my nightstand to apply before i went to bed.\\n    - this little cell phone sized light is a miracle.\\n    - i love it the two bottles shampoo and conditioner are perfet set, do the job that i expect every body loves my gray hair\\n    - i reordered the same color and bottle.\\n    - weve been using them for a few weeks now and really like them.they come in three sizes that are good for smaller portions.\\n    - however would like to see more attractive packaging and bottle.\\n    - love this lotion love this lotion, but wish i had actually read the size of the bottle.\\n    - missrepresented but still acceptable just as expected except the bottle we got appears to be a floor display model, meaning there is no charm on the bottle like normal.\\n    - you only need one a day and i buy the 90 count bottle so i have a 3 month supply.\\n    - not the size shown.\\n    - one bottle which is quite large lasts my husband and i about 2 months.\\n    - i just ordered a second bottle of this product and their pycnogenol complex to see if it helps me to decrease hot flashes as one reviewer noted.\\n    - i dont think the neck area, at least for her body type, is the important measurement when trying to decide on what size to order, since the harness isnt really designed to fit around the neck.\\n    - tiny kitten sized toy.\\n    - the other bottles are worthless without the roller balls\\n    - it gets two stars for the packaging and antioxidants, ceramides, and niacinamide, but thats it.\\n    - i did get a free bottle to .\\n    - after that force the included straws see photos i uploaded into the bottle.\\n    - theres nothing on the packaging that says it is.\\n    - that being said,pros  1.very realistic and natural looking teeth,not super,fake looking white.2.the one size fits all really does seem to fit most,i am male and it fits nearly perfect,although i have heard,for most females it may be a little big,but it can be bent and molded to still fit fine.3.\\n    - i was surprised when it arrived as to the size, for some reason i thought it would be larger i have an aussie, a rottie and a part-great pyrenees, so they are big dogs themselves.\\n    - i really like the size of this item, but the vibration quit after the first use.\\n    - sturdy, standard size, handy dispenser.\\n    - nice size and hold up well\\n    - i saw that they also offer a spray bottle of their solution, but i made my own in a 2oz spray bottle that i purchased at a local store.\\n    - ill report back once i finish the bottle.\\n    - looses suction, best to get a squirt bottle for enemas yull be happier\\n    - to our surprise, the brush heads arrived in clairsonic branded packaging.\\n    - and unlike other water bottles that have to be completely filled to the top to get a good seal or else it will leak this one does not.\\n    - it is the perfect compliment to your bathroom decor, and just the right size too.\\n    - currently its priced at $8.18, while the exact same bottle in lavender is priced at $3.33, why?<br /><br />anyway, while its a nice hand sanitizer, i dont think its worth the price difference, ill be looking for an alternative until amazon or eo products fixes the pricing issue.\\n    - a waste of money this is expensive for a sample size product, but i am glad i did not waste my money on the bigger size.\\n    - i didnt think anything of it until i started using it and found no results from this bottle.\\n    -

so i decided a soft crate was in order, but it was difficult to find one that would be the right size for my dog and still fit in my vehicle.\\n    - paid a small fortune for a travel size product.\\n    - it is easy to wipe down and the stainless steel bowls come out easily to wash and refill.my only gripe is that i purchased a gray food-grade silicone mat from the same company in size small thinking that this pet feeder would fit nicely underneath it to catch any stray bits of food.\\n    - this water bottle has made it very easy for me to work this habit into my lifestyle!the only negative thing i would have to say about it, is that the opening really should be a little larger.\\n    - perfect size kibble for very young kittens.\\n    - received a free bottle for this review!\\n    - the restore wound cleaner was used daily for 3 weeks and we did not have to open the new bottles i ordered to continue treatment.\\n    - i appreciate the size of this protector, as it makes it suitable for use on a larger bed and prevents shifting.\\n    - cable comes with lots of kinks from the packaging, so its hard to get it into the right position in the tank, will have to track down a real suction cup.the device itself drifts up and down a bit, but it does say +/- 1 deg c accuracy.\\n    - love these bottles!\\n    - the packaging is fantastic!\\n    - i use about the same size as the diameter of the tube oriface.\\n    - the case has some weight to it, but not much.the bottle caps do not twist off.\\n    -

the first unit received was missing a control button.the manufacturer responded very quickly to my complaint and sent a new unit which arrived the day after i called-a+ for customer support.the problem with this device is that it way more complicatedrelatively to use than the simple neti pot or squeeze bottle and accomplishes only the same results.admittedly i was seduced by the high tech,clinical look of the item but quickly reverted to old tried and true method of nasal irrigation-squeeze bottle, after a couple of weeks.\\n    - my dog is about 8 pounds and i would recommend the larger size.\\n    - not only are the bristles soft, but its also perfect size to get into tight spots.\\n    - they fool you into thinking you are purchasing a regular size pencil when in reality you are only getting 3 inches or so of makeup, the rest of the product is empty and a waste of resources.\\n    - my dogs is 56 pounds and very strong but is far from rowdy,  she plays with children, plays with all friendly dogs and as a matter of fact is afraid of most a dogs half her size if they bark of growl.i definitely would not waste my money if your dog has separation anxiety and is determined.\\n    - while this outfit looks cute on her, i bought a small and it was still big so i had to adjust it myself.product arrived on time with no problems and as described other than the size issue.\\n    - the plastic is durable, the bowls are a nice size and super handy because theyre removable.\\n    - product is wonderful the shipping price was 44.00 such a rip off on 9 3 oz bottles.\\n    - if coke and pepsi can add this detail to all of their bottles, how can kaytee overlook such a potentially critical detail?\\n    - i like the packaging as well.\\n    - sorry just not like the picture im perplexed with what i think about this bag - the size is great for me i dont need a big bag - the colors rrr fun and the fabric is cool as well as the handle design can go from one to two strap thats cool - but the bag doesnt close properly the flap isnt wide enough to keep contents in the bag - the sides over lap 2in on each side - bummer - ill keep it to store my girly things in may even use it to tote around crochet projects around the fort - but i dont trust carrying around anything valuable<br />peace and grace and so you know love won\\n    - the complete range of sizes is a huge plus, but only if you use rechargeables in all those sizes.\\n    - its a great size and definitely gives hours of delightful fun ;\\n    - i got this toner in a travel size as part of a gift box years ago and loved how well it evened out my skin, i have never used another product that worked this well or this quickly.\\n    -

the bottle it comes in is great and easy to use in the shower.\\n    - my husband removed the oil bottle from the diffuser and dipped a cotton swab into the oil and wiped it on all the cfl bulbs in our living area and let the beast in to hunt down moses.\\n    - its been a little over a month now, just finished the 1st bottle the other day.\\n    - reasonable size.. but the $14.95 price is a little too high.. other cosmetic brands have about the same product for way cheaper..\\n    - right now, im enveloped in caroline herrera, which is stunning and which bowled me over when i sniffed it in the bottle.\\n    - of course, she sees me pour my bottled water in the bowl, so it must be a good thing.\\n    - the water bottle is very tiny and mine has already leaked all the way out once and soaked the shavings on the whole floor.\\n    - i wish amazon prime was available for all sizes.\\n    - one bottle has lasted me for months.<br /><br />i have used so many different products to simply reduce the age/sun spots on my face, but had no idea lytera would actually make them literally disappear.\\n    - not the size promised.\\n    - the body of the suit fit me i wear a size 8 pants.\\n    - this time around it seemed to have less in the packaging.\\n    - one of our many goals is to convert these birds to fresh vegetables, fruits, and other wholesome and nutritious foods, and this includes the introduction to pellets for a completely balanced nutritional diet.the small size of hagen tropican is a perfect size to try on birds, that way you are not heavily invested in a pellet brand that does not appeal to them.\\n    - her water bottle even attaches to the sides because they are wire another reason we went with this model.\\n    - i love the pump bottles, i use it every day\\n    - buying it at home depot will save you coin over even the amazon price, as here it is about $4.50 a bottle, and at home depot it is $3.99 a bottle.\\n    - while this works for my needs, and the price was ok for the size, beware if you really need the larger size container!\\n    - we are on our third bottle and hes still going strong!\\n    - i took it as directed on the bottle.\\n    - ill admit my vision isnt what it used to be, but it shouldnt be necessary to remove the bottle every day to check out remaining supply.\\n    - next time, i remembered that i do not need a dime size.\\n    - not recommended for any dog of any size!\\n    - youll probably drop the bottle repeatedly getting the outer lid off, but there is fortunately an inner screw top.\\n    - the 18 was ok, but extremely tight for someone of my size.\\n    - great oil brought this with two other oils the bottles are pretty big , the oils are lite and absorbs in the skin quickly i forgot i was buying them for my hair after i seen how nicely it felt on my skin.\\n    - cut to size.\\n    - it is 55 wide and most full size truck seats are 60.\\n    - although now ive almost finished this bottle, it was about 2 weeks after i started taking this supplement that i happily noticed i could cross my right leg over my left knee w/o any right hip pain nor was there any bilateral knee pain.\\n    - very convenient packaging if you use a lot of bobby pins with a daughter whos in theater and is a majorette, we were going through bobby pins like nobodys business!\\n    - i will definitely be purchasing this product again, as a matter of fact i just ordered 2 more bottles.\\n    - perfect size for spices.\\n    - one star bottle of something but i cant call it shampoo\\n    - its a bit tricky and you have to wrangle the bottle into it.\\n    - mixes terribly, serving size is too small so you have to use multiple servings to get decent amount of protein, tastes bad, doesnt come with a scoop.\\n    - i have a 135 lb mastiff and i bought the largest size.\\n    - good product keeps em cleak, packaging needs improvement.\\n    - having had low thyroid, we always assumed my hair was falling out because of that.but after receiving large doses of anti-inflammatory medicine, it stopped.i had purchased a bottle of advanced 95 before surgery, so when i returned home i began taking it on a regular basis, along with a bioperene and a now dha 500. i noticed that while taking the curcumin, the healing of my scalp was continuing and my hair loss had become negligible.\\n    - i give 4 stars because it didnt go away after a month and half of use and also it is costly for the size of the bottle and i could not afford to keep using it for that reason.\\n    - i have to assume these bottles have been stockpiled and now being sold.\\n    - it is a must have skin care and i would suggest to buy this larger size.<br /><br />ps i am hope that they would even offer the 240ml size!\\n    - had to write this for a free bottle omega 3. there ya go.\\n    -

the 1mm is a good general length to get if you are getting only one size as it can still be used in sensitive areas, just a bit more gently.\\n    - but i risked it and bought one bottle from amazon.\\n    - the bottle has pills for only 40 servings that is 40*3=120 pills that means the bottle is only hold good for 14 days only and based on the current result and price, is far too expensive and i would say just try something else but not this one.\\n    -

polysorbate 60 is listed on my bottle and raises concern on the ewg.\\n    - great price for size.\\n    - let me tell you, they put the lies in supplies alright  the packaging looked funny to me, so i compared it to the blackout that i already have and the whole thing is a joke.<br /><br />it literally says this on the side of the packaging <br />the ultra charm conductor, illuminates the bee to direct the butterfly highly ingeniously utilizes the static electricity principle, lets the eyelash bythe natural sea and the plant essence cation spread the wings to fly presents the unprecedented volume to curl upwards, the eyelash slender favor, thickly glistens the growth increasea dense and the protection eyelash effect extremely good, the quality of material lithe exquisite eyelash pomade, temprately lastingly maintains you to be perfect accommodates, during contains the rich cellulose, can mold the slender effect.\\n    -

one of our many goals is to convert these birds to fresh vegetables, fruits, and other wholesome and nutritious foods, and this includes the introduction to pellets for a completely balanced nutritional diet.the small size of hagen tropican is a perfect size to try on birds, that way you are not heavily invested in a pellet brand that does not appeal to them.\\n    -

while this outfit looks cute on her, i bought a small and it was still big so i had to adjust it myself.product arrived on time with no problems and as described other than the size issue.\\n    - however, this listing is for four canisters of shave cream, it has to be a pricing or quantity error as it represents more than twice the per unit as can be found anywhere else.\\n    -

i bought an xxlarge for my labmax.there is something seriously wrong about this design when it comes to proportons.i followed the scale of how wide the chest can be per size, however - the strap around the torax is much wider than it should be.- the hoddie is very small for a big dog so it doesn`t cover the ears properly and over all it is too tight.- also the opening around the neck is too tight for my dog`s neck- finally, when you use the hidden elastic straps that go around each back leg to prevent the raincoat from falling to a side, you cannot use the pocket because it is already too tight and stretched on the top from the neck opening to the back legs to fit anything in there.\\n    -

i feel that a placebo effect would explain the significant decrease in muscle soreness that i expected but would not explain the surprising post workout pump and growth which i did not expect at all.i know there are pricy packaged pre/post workout cocktails out there but i like measuring out the exact amounts of the materials i want that are appropriate to my size, diet, timing and regimen.\\n    - i trust youll put the right amount in the box.for all that fuss, i only ding em one star.\\n    - shipping was great, item was disappointing do to size.\\n    - once synced to the computer a process which is easy, and automatic once set up, you can view how many steps, and how many calories youve burned for specific periods of the day, in 15 minute increments.in this case, size really does matter.\\n    -

the nexxus is very thick, i have to squeeze the bottle hard to get the product out, and when i use it i only need about a quarter size, maybe 1.5 quarters, to wash my very long hair.<br /><br />now im a total convert, i will be buying nexxus color assure shampoo and conditioner, because the price is so worth it.\\n    - the complete range of sizes is a huge plus, but only if you use rechargeables in all those sizes.\\n    - in comparison with the furminator, the oster rake removes smaller amounts of undercoat, which i like because the dog has a more even look.\\n    - pros  the size is perfect for our narrow tub, the feet easily adjust, has a lower rack for soaps and shampoos if needed, seems quite sturdy.cons  the seat doesnt twist as easily as id like it to.\\n    - shes only about 12 pounds but has a small face and size 0 fits perfectly.\\n    - one of my cats threw up daily, the other every once in a while.switched to science diet which is only a little more for about the same size bag, the cats stopped puking within a couple days, they had more energy, seemed happier.and the bag has lasted 3 1/2 months and it will last us a total of 4 months when we finish this bag up.pro plan makes my cats act/seem just like the cheap cat food.\\n    - i still have to use some products to take care of the frizz but my hair is shiny and silky.<br /><br />the long plates get larger amounts of hair and iron it fairly quickly – which results in less damage.\\n    - it mosturizes well and lathers up quite well with only a small amount.\\n    - i spent a substantial amount of money on this, and now im going to have to go buy a new cage that will probably be more expensive just because this one couldnt hold up to a 35lb puppy.\\n    - they are very nice size and im not afraid of them breaking as some have one me.\\n    - these are a nice size for small to medium sized dogs.\\n    - it was the size i needed and could not find in a retail store.\\n    - not sure how long it will last because its &34;foamy&34; the actual quantity in it is less.\\n    - just the right size to carry on a walk for that needed water break thats all i have to say but they wont take my review un less its over 20 words long but theyre asking for my feedback\\n    - im amazed by how many people talk-up this product like its the best thing ever.\\n    - if i could change anything about these, id want to add a bigger one to handle family-size leftovers.\\n    - in addition, unilever may have failed to inform consumers that the product contains a chemical known as tetrasodium edta, which is mainly synthesized from formaldehyde.\\n    - i wish amazon prime was available for all sizes.\\n    - when one buys from a salon you are instructed on how much and how to use.\\n    - as long as you are aware of the size, this is a great purchase.\\n    - i can also fit a good sized blanket in it for him.\\n    - ive been extremely consistent and now six months later i occasionally wonder how many surgeries could be prevented if i had simply taken a little better care of myself with products and procedures - that although available, seem expensive - until one considers the ultimate cost to the alternatives surgery, handi-cap, disability, immobility!!!\\n    - i bought the size that was recommended for my dogs size medium and they were too small.\\n    - price on this size on amazon is much better than our local grocery store.\\n    - i was suprised by the size of this sponge-it was huge, though i have small hands, the outside shape is exactly to hold with comfort, inside part is softer-great for the skin, and outside-to scrub the feet.\\n    - its not bulky, it fits in the hand nicely, and gives off the right amount of power.\\n    - xl for us size m. it is comfy.\\n    - add a small amount of white cream on top.\\n    - this is the only product i have ever encountered that i wholeheartedly like.<br /><br />i use a generous pearl sized dab.\\n    - you can find out how many steps or miles you walk or run each day for several days.\\n    - the size was very different from the one i expected.\\n    - [8] ibid.please, never give xylitol in any form, in any amount to any pet.\\n    - after seeing the size and how easy it was to fill i bought one for myself.\\n    - love the bowls just what i needed,for my kitty.great size and love the print and easy to clean!\\n    - i know that my cat will be fed the same amount of food at the same times every day.\\n    - theres a good amount of cushion too.\\n    - i have spent a ridiculous amount of hours researching fish oil supplements over the years.i eventually gave up and relied on amazon.com reviews instead.\\n    - nice size for household use.\\n    - one bottle contains half the protein that an adult requires in a day 25 grams and has only 5 grams of sugar, plus a lot of other vitamins and minerals.in comparison, special k contains about half the amount of protein and three times the amount of sugar, and it does not taste as good in my opinion.\\n    - it also works wonderfully well on the bikini line and it lasts for a decent amount of time.\\n    - my two dogs love this one gets out and the other is right on the tail of the first to get into it need to buy the larger size for the bigger dog\\n    - right size and next to no weight in my shorts pocket.\\n    - would be great on your arms, however the container size is small for large area application.\\n    - she wears a size medium in the zack & zoey hoody which fits her better.\\n    - the quality and size are great - i have a toyota highlander.\\n    - dont you want to bet my credit card was charged for whole amount??!\\n    - though the previous reviewer said the collar was too large, i believe she simply ordered the smallest size without looking at the description or measuring her dogs neck-- the collar is actually much smaller than the amazon description states.size  w-2.0 cm x l-35 cm extends till 45 cm.this means that the collar should be over 17 inches which is admittedly huge for a small collar.the collar i received has a maximum extended length of 35cm, and barely fits my border collie mix who wears a 14.5 collar.im very frustrated by the sizing problems, but the collar works and appears to be fairly well made.\\n    - the watchis too bulky in the middle to be worn comfortably at night.i would also like to say that fitibits customer service has been horrible with trying to address some of my concerns.i had planned on giving them the benefit of the doubt and seeing if the xl size would alleviate some of theproblems with hr acquisition, but the xl is on some horribly long back order.\\n    - comparing to the diva cup, the sckoon felt more ergonomical, maybe because of the size difference 23 ml vs 30ml or the shape difference sckoon is much more bell shaped.\\n    - great size and lasts a long time.\\n    - match size with ice pack.\\n    - a medium sized dog that is not an aggressive chewer would be the perfect candidate for this toy.\\n    - the glycerite is nice to have when you need a very small amount .\\n    - my only complaint is that the sizes are inconsistent.\\n    - how much do my 3 cats love these treats?a lot.they go at these scarf-style they eat their treats noticing nothing else until the treat is done.a few points.\\n    - no matter how much you tighten the unit, it rattles and squeals well beyond acceptable levels.\\n    - it is easy to wipe down and the stainless steel bowls come out easily to wash and refill.my only gripe is that i purchased a gray food-grade silicone mat from the same company in size small thinking that this pet feeder would fit nicely underneath it to catch any stray bits of food.\\n    - i have to say i was concerned at first when i saw the size of these glucosamine for dogs chews - they are somewhat on the large size.however, those fears were allayed when i saw how readily our three doggies gobbled them up.having said that, we usually add one of these chews to their food each day, and either they dont notice theyre there, or they just love them.either way, were happy that they are getting a proven combination of ingredients that will help them live a healthy, happy, pain free life.\\n    - lasted a reasonable amount of time, but not nearly as long as others.\\n    - the food bowl is an okay size and she enjoys sitting in it and throwing her food around.\\n    - this is the very best, it has the most amount per tablet that i have seen and it seems to be very effective.\\n    - a full assault on both the senses of sight and smell.i much prefer biobags for this purpose -- but my dog requires the large size, and those are currently unavailable on amazon.\\n    - just wish i realized how much water it truly can hold\\n    - was sent the wrong size.\\n    - the pump is a problem for the roc cream here - it gives you way too much per pump; however trial and error i found about 1/4 pump dispenses the right amount.<br /><br />impressions  i dont really notice any better results compared to neutrogena.\\n    - these are a nice size.\\n    - make sure you use their sizing chart because they will fit perfectly if you order the right size.\\n    - the nice vendor we got them from not only sent us the correct size, but told us we could donate the wrong size to our locate shelter.how sweet is that????\\n    - now i need to find the next size down to get the ends to turn under a little more - next winter, longer hairstyle, back to this one.\\n    - the body of the suit fit me i wear a size 8 pants.\\n    - the size of the bottle it is contained in isnt the size of the oil it is a cardboard container that contains a much smaller vial than the competitors plus it costs more for less.\\n    - for the size of these i wish they lasted longer.\\n    - however, as a layman bodybuilder i can honestly say the materials that i sourced through bulk supplements have helped me increase muscle size and strength quickly while minimizing recovery periods.issues with muscle recovery have limited my physique for years but i felt uncomfortable using supplements due totally to my ignorance.\\n    - i use only the two largest size rollers for my particular hairstyle.\\n    - the size is good and holds the 3 gallons well.\\n    - business card size, but with all the information.\\n    - bounty.skinny size?.\\n    - both bowls we purchased had significant amounts of hard, black residue stuck and i do mean stuck to both the interior and exterior of the bowl.\\n    - i used it pretty fast so i had to buy from bulk apothecary, where the castor oil was more affordable with larger amounts!!\\n    - the description did not provide the size.\\n    - since it can be hard to get enough vitamin d in one day, i got these and was pleasantly surprised with the size of the pills.\\n    - the size is just what i was looking for and it has helped contain the mess of refilling her food bowl.\\n    - the cost is higher than the regular feed but if you are a bird enthusiast, it is worth the extra cost~~if you figured how much seed was being stolen by the squirrels and wasted perhaps the cost wont seem that high.\\n    - i measure the amounts exactly so there is no issue there.\\n    - i know it has a lot of great benifits, but no matter how much essential oils i use in my body butter to cover the smell of the shea butter, i can never quite cover up or get past that funky smell \\n    - the 1.5mm is quite long and would be good for occasional deep tissue stimulation where there is thicker skin, such as the back.<br /><br />hope that helps.ength to get if you are getting only one size as it can still be used in sensitive areas, just a bit more gently.\\n    - the plug it in notification seems pretty pointless to me considering it tells you how much juice you have left in the battery too!<br /><br />the bad <br />like i said in the good, it gives me a good shave.\\n    - charge it and run it through a series of cycles until it dies at the highest temp, and this will take care of a good amount of the smell/taste.\\n    - with a little bit of hairspray curls come out perfect with all the barrel sizes.\\n    - i had to take the cushion out and replace it with a blanket, though, because shes a little bigger than the size of dog this bed is intended for and she would always scrunch the cushion up going inside.\\n    - true to size, longest widest liner i seen yet!\\n    - finally a bolus you dont have to down size.\\n    - perfect size.\\n    - i have two medium sized dogs.\\n    - it smells like they dumped an economy-sized bottle of grandmas heaviest and gaudiest perfume into the mixture.\\n    - in small amounts, it can be really good for hair.\\n    - when i reorder i will order a shade lighter..  i suggest ordering the smallest amount to see if you like the color first.\\n    - anyways, its the perfect size for 4 rats maximum.\\n    - it comes with 2 cuffs- one for people with large upper arms and one for people with regular sized arms.\\n    - the orange style has an equal amount of support on both the arch and the outer part of the foot.\\n    - the quality and size are great - i have a toyota highlander.\\n    - we have noticed a big difference in the shedding amount in our dogs for sure!\\n    - i love the little tags that go with it very nice.i dont know how long theyll stay these usually dont last long just because of how much our dogs run and hunt around on the farm.\\n    - quantity was not communicated by amazon to entirely pets who actually stocked and sent the item.\\n    - lol start a marble size and work your way up over a couple weeks up to a blob a half the size of a golf ball.\\n    - most birds that have only experienced a seed based diet will usually reject the pellets in the beginning, but here are a few different ways that have worked for us.1 try mixing a small amount of seeds in with the pellets, many seed based diets have done the same thing.2 if your bird has a favorite type of fresh food, vegetables, fruit, or whatever he/she favors, sprinkle some pellets over this food as a ‘crunchy’ addition to the favored ‘treat’.\\n    - thier cage has 3 parrot sized and quality chews for them, they have toys and enrichment gear in there, but being rats, if they can escape, they will.\\n    - this scale is the perfect size; it tucks out of the way nicely.\\n    - the trick is in your own technique i.e., how much pressure you apply.\\n    - sometimes i have to cut it down to fit my junior-sized shirts which is a little annoying.\\n    - dime-sized and great for training.\\n    - adjustable and true to size.\\n    - while i do not use the metal bottom or guard, i think both features work very well on a pan of this size unlike the smaller litter pans in which neither the guard nor the great are all that practical or effective.\\n    - how much can you love a filter?\\n    - i bought this in size medium, but needed a large.\\n    - mostly the pellets got stuck in the machine.i dont know how much smaller they expect the pellets to be but these are really small and they dont work.\\n    - however, the only time i will need it to roll is when i move it to retrieve other pet items behind it, which isnt a major ordeal.all in all, i would recommend this container because of the size, added bonuses, color, and overall price.\\n    - its surprising how many people do not own scales.\\n    - i love the price, size, and benefits!\\n    - i give 4 stars because it didnt go away after a month and half of use and also it is costly for the size of the bottle and i could not afford to keep using it for that reason.\\n    - my cat wont use traditional sized hooded litter boxes.\\n    - these are basic, durable nail clippers suitable for dogs of all sizes.\\n    - adorable very cute but small brushes not full size\\n    - it came very quickly and a huge amount for the price.\\n    - i was looking for something to help spread out the amount of time between my massage therapy appointments.\\n    - all the different sizes are awesome.\\n    - i got a large size for a good price.\\n    - the xs is the perfect size for my 3.5-4.5 lb yorkies but the s will still fit, which is a bonus if you have a growing puppy.\\n    - i got this and newts large size chew to compare between my 2 dogs.\\n    - the size large was a little bit too big for my 55 pound dog.\\n    - wished it came in a bigger size\\n    - i tried a few different sizes too.\\n    - these are a good size for body with a little curl.\\n    - it has a velcro strap to adjust my head is size 7, fits snug around my eyes and nose without letting in light.\\n    - quite good, handy size for nano tanks.\\n    - we used it 3 months and lost a great amount of weight, and have been maintaining with taking a pill every other day.\\n    - it is the perfect size all around and it can be taken anywhere with you too because it is not overly sized.\\n    - amazon has the best price and its great to get it in this large economical size.\\n    - good quantity of bags.\\n    - the vest is lightweight, and sturdy, and seems to sit quite comfortably on my tiny cocker spaniel.i was a bit thrown off by the many customer reviews that claimed that the vest was too small, so i purchased a size m 21 - 27, for my 20lb cocker who is exactly 22 chest girth.\\n    - for my size 13 feet this unit is not large enough although it portends to be.\\n    - it had consistently reproducible results that were accurate when compared to my bodyweight and amount of alcohol ingested.\\n    - any so much more economical to use this product, which is blened by professionals who know just how many drops of this or that to get the just right fragrance.\\n    - tnx i made the photo of my old 4 years sponge and the new one i just received today, they are very strong and last long, i like even smaller size\\n    - the playtex sport combo packs are currently available in two sizes, one with pads and the other with liners.\\n    - each time i check, a different cat is on the toy, so they do manage to share it, although not without a certain amount of thumping and hissing.be sure to get some replacement interiors.\\n    - runs small im usually a size medium top and i ordered a large so it would be loose but when it came i could barely even put it on.\\n    - thats how much they live it.\\n    - feline bite-sized chews for the relief theyve given my baby and me.\\n    - however this is used in such a small amount we have gotten some in him.\\n    - mens glove size - small.\\n    - i have ordered online and purchased in stores i cant tell you how many of these harness type halters for my little 4lb pomeranian and finally this one fits her and she even dips her head into for me because she knows now it is so comfortable to wear and she gets to go outside and play without the lease chocking her when we are walking or when i have her tied up for a short time outside.\\n    - the complete range of sizes is a huge plus, but only if you use rechargeables in all those sizes.their charge for months, where lesser batteries hold a charge only a couple days after charging.\\n    - it is a nice size and pretty durable considering two dogs are chewing on it.\\n    - i have been looking for this size puff & very hard to find,  glad i did.\\n    - from the picture i thought this would be a good pocket comb, but the size only about half a standard pocket comb makes it more of a mustache and beard comb.\\n    - cats can knock a few pellets loose with their paws but not many and they usually dont bother to try.the good works reliably as advertised so far, only had it a few weeksthe bad only works well with round foodcant use batteries and power adapter at the same time so power failure resets itinstructions suckintructions - the procedure for adjusting how much is dispensed doesnt state that theres a pin that prevents moving the slider door up and down so you have to pry the side of the door facing you up to get the pin out of its slot before the door will slide.\\n    - perfect size exactly what i needed !\\n    - the other big brands you can find in the drugstore were just too big, even the small sized ones.\\n    - just take all the pieces and organize them by size, then look at the instruction picture and it will all make sense.the only complaint and its not valid at this price point is that the bases are compressed wood chips rather than solid wood.\\n    - im starting to see a fair amount of peach fuzz up top by my frontal hairline.\\n    - i think its a very mild type of glue but i cant be sure exactly what that sticky stuff is that holds down the flap on the back of the package.overall, you just cant ask for better quality tissues when youre on the go and cant carry a large size box with you!\\n    - so a serving size of 2 scoops is pretty difficult to figure out.\\n    - i like the size of the soft gels and its easy to swallow.\\n    - a serving size is one chew, and each chew is 15 calories.\\n    - not impressed, the fish are all the same sizes and they look fake, but hey, they are fake which eliminates cleaning my tank.\\n    - i noticed a decrease in the amount of inflammation, swelling, and pain within a few days of starting life extension gla product.\\n    - this size is better for larger pets, as my cat, 8 lbs, is almost too small to fit in it safely.\\n    - perfect size kibble for very young kittens.\\n    - my only wish is that they also made it in a smaller size.\\n    - these are a great size and work well.\\n    - shredded aspen in this amount for this price is the only way to go.\\n    - size is about 17.5 in x 29.5 in\\n    - i also love the fact that this tool can wave a good size amount of hair at one time.\\n    - very absorbent, large size and well made.\\n    - i mean that in a good way, as i only used the recommended pea-sized amount; this stuff does go a long way and the ingredients list includes olive oil, which might explain the extreme shine oddly, the stuff isnt greasy in your hands.\\n    - the mega size fits the regular toilet paper holder so you dont have to buy an extension.\\n    - dogs love them, just the right size and made in the usa\\n    - just as importantly, i received excellent customer service regarding uniformity of size.\\n    - nicely sized as well.\\n    - the issue that i cant seem to work around is that it leaves my skin feeling greasy after i put it on no matter how much i rub it in.\\n    - love the holiday green it is a perfect holiday color with just the right amount of sparkles in it.\\n    - good size, a little wobbly.\\n    - first, it arrived quickly & packaged nicely.i havent been taking it long enough to notice any weight loss, however, i like that it has just a small amount of caffeine less than a cup of coffee to give me just a little pep in my step when needed.\\n    - i wanted to show off the relative sizes and provide as best as a video can do a comparison of the noise made by the two models.\\n    - i have a 135 lb mastiff and i bought the largest size.\\n    - i had trouble finding the right size for my expensive stainless steel kitchen 10 gallon garbage can.\\n    - i could not for the life of me get this to rub in .if you put the doctor recommended quarter-size dollop on your face and neck, you may as well be rubbing elmers glue on!\\n    - good size for my pomeranian.\\n    - i recently bought him a medium sized one to make it easier to carry and it is holding up well also.\\n    - you can vary the size of the dot by changing the amount of pressure you apply with even the biggest tool.\\n    - im not all the way finish with the bottle but i have notice a change in my size.\\n    - great for nail designs, the doting sizes are not to different from each other but once you get a hold of the am mount of nail polish you need for each size you will be able to see more difference.\\n    - probably an xxl would not fit most 20-lb dogs.i also bought a size xl, for my sisters 12-lb maltese, which fits him pretty well he wears a size small in zack & zoey.the colors are nice and bright.\\n    - size is way off.\\n    - again, the product is exactly what i want and need but i definitely need the larger quantity.can anyone be of assistance in this regard?\\n    - this is a strong, small pump but i had trouble keeping the tubing attached and even a rather small amount for debris would block it.\\n    - but the last two bags of normal size and the last giant size i purchased have shown inferior quality.\\n    - 2. inconsistent feeding amounts - alter the dispensing with an index card via my technique - works well!\\n    - i had not checked how much my $12 would buy, but there was 3 oz!\\n    - you may want to try the next size up.i got the medium 16-inch for my 15lb schnoodle and it fits perfectly.\\n    - perfecft size to feel filled up.\\n    - it is a very nice size, and i think that if it had .\\n    - i love it and it is cuter than the picture, a great size and is very durable.\\n    - you pay a good dollar for these pads and i started to notice things, the size is smaller than the other pads and the 23x23 size meant i had to use 2 of them in my crates and on a side note the actual size of usable pad is 21x21.\\n    - these are just fine and main reason i bought was for quantity.\\n    - i dont really like that it doesnt say how many probiotic cells you are getting per serving.\\n    - the size is perfect for her, shes a medium sized dog about 35 pounds.\\n    - i used a nickle sized drop and used a rolling flat iron as usual.\\n    - i also like the fact that there isnt much packaging involved, which reduces the amount of waste in general.\\n    - great self tanner this is one of my favorite self tanning lotions its instant tan & also over night darkens more this comes out bronze so you have no problems seeing where your applying it it also gives my face a glow it has like a shiny glow to the face when applyed to your face i love this product its so resonably priced & you get a nice amount of product the tan lasts a week & gradually goes away doesnt lok blotchy & iccky as it fades it just gets lighter & lighter like your just loosing a real tan & has a nice smell not a yucky self tanner smell you can also chhose from light to meduium to dark i like the dark but everyone has to pick the shade that suits them the best  \\n    -

i got this to have for my small dog when i travel and it is perfect size for her.the color is perfect for her as well.\\n    - we have two lionheads, so theyre not huge, and this is the perfect size for them.\\n    - we call them hahas smiply because it is so funny how much she enjoys something that is good for her teeth.\\n    - when i go packing across europe next year, i am taking this with me.well recommended for walking small to medium-sized dogs, or for easy access to small items when backpacking.\\n    -

the very same soap and size.\\n    - the xl just barely fit her.i bought the size large at the pet store thats the largest size they have, and they really dont quite fit her - the sides come un-velcroed if she stretches too much or moves too much.so i came online to buy the largest size available xl.\\n    - i have a rottie and i determined her size from the chart well the xl were too big so i suggest you get a size smaller then what you would normally think would fit.\\n    - here is my recipe for perfect curls<br /><br />wash and lightly condition heavy conditioners will weigh hair down and retard curling<br /><br />wet hands and apply dime to quarter size of be curly to ends no need for it close to scalp<br /><br />twirl hair on finger in 6  to 8 sections always twirl directionally away from face<br /><br />let air dry -

the scalen is very light weight and you can read the weight amount easy.\\n    - my boxer doesnt seem to shed but its amazing how much hair comes out!\\n    - its an awesome shirt a little smaller than what it says so i would go with size bigger especially if you plan on washing and drying it often i would probably go maybe two sizes bigger but its awesome shirt fits my pit just wish i would have just got a bigger size because i do wash and dry\\n    - i dont know why other reviewers were complaining about the amount of product in the can -- an ounce of catnip is a lot, considering you only need to sprinkle a pinch for your cat to become a stoner.\\n    - this box is a great size and worked well with the litter bags we use ,very pleased.\\n    - i ended up liking all four of them and am currently waiting for full sizes of the hot pink and gold to arrive.\\n    -

*the fountain holds a good amount of water, it normally lasts about 2-3 days for me with my two cats.\\n    - the size makes this hand held brush easy to use.\\n    - i like the size, it seems to be well made so far, dog doesnt mind wearing it 105 lb lab.\\n    - i use about the same size as the diameter of the tube oriface.\\n    - our medium sized dog loved this toy for almost 7 months this is a long time in dog months before we had to get rid of it.\\n    - he loves them, they last quite a while, and when they get two small for him to hold we put them in the microwave and they get about twice their size and become an easily chewed and swallowed snack.\\n    - i would buy again, but maybe a bigger size if they have them.\\n    - i like the size and the feel of the silicone is great, but it leaks and i had to use waterline tape plumbers know what i mean to stop the leak.\\n    - i was surprised when it arrived as to the size, for some reason i thought it would be larger i have an aussie, a rottie and a part-great pyrenees, so they are big dogs themselves.\\n    - she has adapted very well in a short amount of time.\\n    -

though i have to limit the quantity so she doesnt scarff the whole bag at one feeding, she will eat these when she wont eat anything else.\\n    - i tried upping the amount i used, but that simply made my hair greasy without increasing the smoothness -

i just bought a new one to switch off with my old one for washings, and i was surprised to see how much my old one had softened up.\\n    - we also can not have her sleep in these at night as they are prone to leak if shes in them for over 6 hours - a problem that has been alleviated by placing her in huggies pure & natural size 2 at night.\\n    - so this was a great size for her.\\n    - sizes run very small.\\n    - i contacted alegory and they refunded me the amount right away.\\n    - i also told a friend about it and she used it on her rabbits ears that had sores from the rabbit itching them so much and she said within a short amount of time the sores started healing up and eventually the ears went back to normal with no itching or sores.\\n    - only problem is for most big dogs - say over 90 lbs - the neck size is too big even for the 25 collar and you have to get 2 of them joined together to fit their neck.\\n    - she likes things that soften as she chews or are already soft.she loves these.the addition of sucrose makes me pretty sure this will not be a repeat purchase.a similar treat with sucrose left all three with soft stools so they are only getting 1/3 of a treat at a time.fortunately, they break apart easily so portioning each treat into just a taste size is no problem.\\n    -

turmeric has had amazing results with my daughter-in-law who had swelling in one area of her body for years and this was completely resolved.\\n    - you can get as much hydration and same results from cheaper products.\\n    - forget the scrubs and exfoliators, i have spent so much money on them just to get not very good results.\\n    - i know i cant give it to her at bedtime and see results all night.\\n    - its a decent exfoliating system with far less sting than most, but i had hoped for more pronounced results given the price tag.\\n    - i cant comment on the fat burning, but the appetite suppression and satiety is so effective that i literally forgot to eat one day!\\n    - the long reach really helps me feel that i can effectively get clean.\\n    -

im very happy with the results, well worth the $$ and quite a bit cheaper than any of the local retailers anywhere in the area that ive found, living in ct.\\n    - to be honest,im very disapointed in this product,it did get rid of a few fleas but we are still having to pick fleas off her every day,ive used this product in the past with very good results,an she is a inside dog,so i dont know if i got a bad batch or what happened but it didnt work very well for us an i got for 21-55 lb dog an she weights only 22 lbs,so she should have been covered very well,probably will just buy from the vet office from now on\\n    - out of all the similar products i tried, this one is the best and most effective!\\n    - although they say that you need to use the product for 4 weeks to see optimal results, i swear, in just a week i saw the limp become a distant memory.\\n    - i take 1 with breakfast and 1 with dinner and love the overall results with daily use.\\n    - my method  -- i used 12 15% gel for 6 weeks that the dentist provided -- i used 835% gel for 4 weeks that i bought from amazon -- i applied twice a day for at least half the time -- i used between 1/3 to 1/2 of the syringe per application in all, you have to be patient and not expect quick results.\\n    - it kept getting caught and couldnt really do an effective job of cutting hair on the neck or back of the head.\\n    - not effective for me, probably because it is a hard pill.\\n    - the clippers are thick and sharp; ive been fairly pleased with the results.\\n    - with those properties plus ceraves moisturizing properties, it allowed my skin to clear up very fast and better than any other product ive used in the past.<br /><br />despite hating lotion because ive never seen any results, i will admit that this lotion by cerave actually did something for me.\\n    - if you truly want results.this is the tool   .\\n    - i did not start taking these for bp, so these results were completely unexpected and fantastic.\\n    - too expensive for zero results.\\n    - my wife loves the results of the these products !\\n    - not only does it work, but its alcohol free and not all chemicals.\\n    - i cant really judge on this products effectiveness since it made me nauseous upon taking it.\\n    - the only bad part was, despite testing it with good results first, that my lady bits got severely irritated.\\n    - i have gone through two boxes and it is very effective.\\n    - what i love about this mascara is how long it made my lashes!!\\n    - the results are amazing.\\n    - purchased one for my mother with good results.\\n    - i love the little tags that go with it very nice.i dont know how long theyll stay these usually dont last long just because of how much our dogs run and hunt around on the farm.\\n    - so once again it has to be applied at least twice  a week in order to be effective.\\n    - i thought it might take 3 or so orders of this before wed get such noticeable results.\\n    - i didnt really think much about it when i discovered these were caplets until i realized over time that i was not getting the same results from this product.\\n    - three stars smells great, but only average results.\\n    - i am 29, so i dont have too many fine lines or wrinkles yet to evaluate the products effectiveness on; however, it has made my sensitive skin so smooth and soft.\\n    - i as did others and my stylist saw results with bosley in a months time.\\n    - thankfully they are totally normal the rest of the day due to my strict diet and active lifestyle, but nothing i tried was able to lower my fasting blood sugars.then i tried taking two of these before bed and instantly saw results!\\n    - results are just as advertised.\\n    - durable and effective.\\n    - effective i wanted to get a product for my dark circles and changing skin because i noticed a gradual difference in my appearance after years of makeup and long nights working/studying.\\n    - you dont need to use very much to see results.\\n    - i didnt notice any results difference between the two and the syntha 6 tastes better.\\n    - frustrating.if anyone has any tips on how i might be doing something wrong, or how to improve my results, im certainly open to suggestions.\\n    - the brush is small and can reach your smaller lashes but i still have better results using my regular mascarra.\\n    - use the lowest effective dose to treat your symptoms.\\n    - it wasnt as orange as like spray on tan & i honestly never really noticed until i looked at pictures of me & people told me . but the snooki ultra hot left a nice brown color  at 1st i was skeptical cuz i didnt notice much of a difference till i woke up plus i used jwowws lotion & wasnt impressed at all  im not going to lie the redness after you use it lasts a while but it goes away, & the tingle sensation isnt painful just more irritating & itchy then other tingerlers ive use in the past but it is tolerable none the less & way worth it because of the results you get.\\n    - my energy level is up and continues to climb.i began with only 1/8th of a teaspoon and am at this time, 4 weeks later, only take 1 heaping teaspoon and having these results.\\n    - great results.\\n    - i noticed that there are several products out right now with this two-step process toting great results for firming/enhancing the under eye area.\\n    - i am getting inconsistent results, blowing .05, then .12. this product is in need of improvement before i can recommend its purchase.\\n    - not greasy but an effective moisturizer.\\n    - not sure how well it works, not seeing significant results.\\n    - to get close to the results i was looking for i had to use both sides of 6 blades and i had to go over the area quite a few times to get the skin about the same smoothness since like i stated before small patches were all i could get off.\\n    - super effective.\\n    - now comes the test of time to see if it stays that way .\\n    - i was pleased with the results!\\n    - i purchased this product with doubt in mind, but have been pleased with the results.\\n    - ive been using it for a week very thoroughly, and so far 0 results.\\n    - no uncomfortable hot spots in the process and for once i dont need to use a towel to protect my ears, neck and shoulders from intense heat as the drawstring effectively keeps the hot air where it belongs.\\n    - ive tried everytjing under the sun to loose weight and stay healthy for the past 25 years and i mean every method, system,group,pill you name it i did it sadly to no lasting results.until i found the gabriel method and was introduced to cellular release!cellular release amazed me it truly produces results !have experience a lot of things?\\n    - unexpected health results.\\n    - cheap, not very effective.\\n    - so far love the results!\\n    - it is not really effective because only 2 temperature settings are displayed and you have to guesstimate the others  the design is nice and it came with a few extras such as the argan oil.\\n    - it loses some effectiveness because even my sneezing will trigger it.\\n    - this is an convenient way and cost effective way to get it all at bedtime!also no binder or filler or magnesium stearate crud\\n    - i wanted to see how this compared with my older electric defuzzer, so decided to try this.it was pretty effective for removing the wool pills on my jacket, but did generate a lot of dust.\\n    - then i contacted the manufacturer  its 60% hca, the recommended dose for results.\\n    -

if you want a cheap and effective electric razor, then this is hard to beat.\\n    - this product cost lot more than most products available in the market and so i was hoping to see better results.\\n    -

very effective and useful when the sun rises so early.\\n    - seems quite effective.\\n    - the first unit received was missing a control button.the manufacturer responded very quickly to my complaint and sent a new unit which arrived the day after i called-a+ for customer support.the problem with this device is that it way more complicatedrelatively to use than the simple neti pot or squeeze bottle and accomplishes only the same results.admittedly i was seduced by the high tech,clinical look of the item but quickly reverted to old tried and true method of nasal irrigation-squeeze bottle, after a couple of weeks.\\n    - it does the job of a regular toothpaste in keeping your teeth fresh and clean but it also does an effective job in whitening it.\\n    - when scooping a spoon of it from the jar, it goes in too easily in my opinion.in conclusion, i think that natures way probably uses an extraction process that incorporates a lot of air into the product, which results in less for your money.\\n    -

one multi-treatment so far i like the results that i am seeing with this product.\\n    - my guess why - product is not as effective, less lubricating, less foamy that aveenos therapeutic gel, which is quite similar- fragrance is the fragrance of soybeans, very slightly like sour milk.\\n    - i am encouraged by the results and i hope it has good results for you too.\\n    - i switched to eartborn holistic brand with much better results.\\n    - results based on non-custom trays are invalid in my opinion and should not reflect on the rating.\\n    -

but it also depends on the person who uses this product with the proper diet and excersize to help get the desired results.\\n    - somewhat effective.\\n    - i am goingâ to be orderingâ some more prettyâ soon butâ read it betterâ to use it inâ cyclesâ lest say am 75% happyâ withâ the resultsâ but i wanted to get big to honestâ but again maybe its the workâ outs am doing but this product really works\\n    -

great results with baby quasar red.\\n    - great results even on the low settings.\\n    - ive been using this product for a while now, and i have seen great results, but that is only because i have been drinking a lot of water with it.\\n    - 3.80may 2013, before taking sonne 9 test resultscholesterol .\\n    - not very effective.\\n    - he suggests me the notion of testing products in market, and he gave me this blog to see the results right after.\\n    - i also cut out real sugar   it supposedly turns to testosterone in the female body after youve had what your body needs each day i smoke and drink coffee everyday  so you that dont might have better results than me  \\n    -

well after seeing no results from this bottle i have come to the conclusion it is a fake!\\n    - i tried it twice with the same results.\\n    - as a safe-guard, you need to double-bag, using 2 per scoop-up to ensure theres no poo-oozing onto your hands, so the cost-savings of buying in bulk results in a loss, compared to other bags.\\n    -

additionally, i like the fact that one can wear nail polish and still be able to apply the product effectively.\\n    - smooth, simple, effective i may be the first person on earth to be disappointed by an &34;age reducing&34; product that actually worked, but  i kind of am.<br /><br />a couple years ago, my dermatologist made it quite clear i should be using a moisturizer with spf every single day.\\n    - the ability to purchase replacement parts instead of the entire mask makes it much more cost effective.\\n    - this very finely made plush microfiber towel may be designed for the ladies with long hair who care about how long it takes to dry those beautiful tresses with an emphasis on hair protection, but for men this towel is equally effective - especially as we age and the amount of hair loss each day is exacerbated by rough, tough towel drying of the hair or worse yet, speeding up the process with a hair dryer!\\n    - throughout the day i feel no joint related aches and it has become a little easier to do certain exercises that had been more challenging due to joint related problems.im in my mid 20s so i cannot speak for every one when i say that this gives immediate results, but i can confidently say that these ingredients are perfectly combined & the results are beneficial to everyday life.the one down fall is the amount of pills that you must take.\\n    - it took a considerate amount of time before i truly began to enjoy the results, but it states it takes approximately 12 weeks to really see results.\\n    - by far, the most effective product i have ever used!\\n    - the purina glucotest packet i purchased was easy to use and according to my vet, the results are reliable.\\n    - ive been using it for four weeks now and already i see major results.\\n    - from what i researched and the dentists input, results widely vary.\\n    - does it work, yep!\\n    - yeah, 3 coats sounds like a lot, but the results make it totally worth it!\\n    - eucalyptus essential oil is colorless and has a distinctive taste and odor.user of eucalyptus oil are <br /><br />1.eucalyptus essential oil is effective for treating a number of respiratory problems including cold, cough, runny nose, sore throat, asthma, nasal congestion, bronchitis and sinusitis.\\n    - if the lotion/cream is necessary, then i am unsure how to rate the effectiveness of the derma roller for reducing wrinkles since the skin can absorb an ant-wrinkle lotion/cream without it.\\n    - very easy and the results are fantastic!\\n    - it provides the necessary cushioning on the bridge of the nose, but the uniform thickness results in significant leakage at the edges of my mirage nasal mask where the pad goes under the mask.\\n    - i havent nicked myself once since using this, and the tiny dot i use for each armpit has effectively eliminated razor burn in that area as well.<br /><br />i also shaved my boyfriends face for him the other day, of course using cremo, and although his facial hair was slightly longer than is best for shaving, it went great and his skin was very smooth after.<br /><br />while i dont shave daily, i can say that my first tube has lasted me probably around five months now, and is still going strong, which is incredible.\\n    - it clearly does, but your results may vary.\\n    - not only does it work, but my dogs look at me funny if i dont put it in their water!\\n    - well, i didnt take them every consecutive day and the results i expected were not met but it still helped a little bit providing me some energy .\\n    - safe and effective a moisturizer with the benefits of retinol.\\n    - i love the added benefit of the coconut oil in these pills, the size is great in that it is so small there is no discomfort.i look forward to seeing results and will update this review as i see results.\\n    - highly recommend both as a durable, high quality product and as a very effective motivator for those of us who have drifted into a way-too-sedentary lifestyle.\\n    - just because of that i will be trying another brand, but i still give this one high marks for ease of use and effectiveness.\\n    - i love how much brighter my face look but you need to be consistent in using this serum to get great results.\\n    - i seem to be having success and wanted to see how long it would take to get completely white teeth.\\n    - easy to read and super fast results.\\n    - ive tried other brands and not seen results.\\n    - i have at least 3 other friends who have used intelligender and the results were accurate so i just knew it was accurate for me as well.\\n    - my husband and i even purchased a second intelligender to see if the results would be different this time, but no.\\n    - but anyway, i tried this tea and saw no additional results.\\n    - an effective, natural alternative to dryer sheets.\\n    - i tried a few products but nothing gave me any indication that they would be effective even after long term use.\\n    - ive only used this twice so far since i just received it a few days ago but do find it effective in what it claims to do.\\n    - an effective energy supplement.\\n    - a bark collar is much more effective than this product to decrease noise both inside and out- sorry i wasted my money.\\n    - the healing process is a bit long, but that depends on how long you have the light on the tattoo.\\n    - test resultscholesterol .\\n    - i used it with my home made sugar, cinnamon, and olive oil mixture applied with a stiff bristle toothbrush and the results were astounding.\\n    - otherwise, its a great product thats easy to use and gives quick, painless results.\\n    - for effectiveness the volume must be up.\\n    - just received so i cant say anything about effectiveness just yet ill update my review once i have something to say but i can speak to the refrigeration question!\\n    - i got my results almost immediately.\\n    - easy to swallow and effective!.\\n    - i am impressed that tropican contains not just the usual corn, but also soybean meal, ground wheat, soybean oil, peanut kernels, sunflower kernels, brewers rice, oat groats, flaxseed meal, spirulina, and a number of natural oils and other ingredients that apparently results in higher acceptance among birds that are not necessarily found in other major-brand pellets.\\n    - great results when you have no time to wait!\\n    - i have been practicing over the last couple of weeks and everybody can’t stop raving about my hair.<br />it is different than any other curler that i have used before, but i found it really easy to use and i am so thrilled with the results.<br /><br />if you are looking for an easy to use, safe and effective curling iron than don’t hesitate, this is an amazing product.\\n    - by making the dewormer easy to administer and an effective remedy, it makes parasite control less of a trial.\\n    - bought the second after very good results with the first initially purchased two for myself at two separate times.\\n    - we used these little movers with our first child, and were satisfied with the results.\\n    - great results for this rookie!\\n    - four stars bought this for my mom, she likes it cause its a mild but effective cleanser.\\n    - was ineffective on our pet-vomit stain & odor.\\n    - very effective and prefer it over anything else ive tried orally.\\n    - even prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on purina one, all she wanted to do was to sleep.i think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, itll be more effective.however, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.\\n    - needless to say im not pleased with the results.\\n    - bought the second after very good results with the first.\\n    - very fast results.but maybe not as durable as it should be.\\n    - i think painting the piece with just plain ole paint would have netted the same results.\\n    - in my case it actually did me a favor by removing the ugly bar logo from some glasses i had, but you may not want the same results.\\n    - i dont know why it took us so long to try the wet-stop3, but we are very happy with the results.\\n    - hang in there and give it time and you should see results.\\n    - oh my hair i have been using bumble and bumble along with my laser hair hood and the results have been great.\\n    - five stars this product has shown results after only one week.\\n    - after this happened i did a google search and a bunch of results came up with people that shared the same experience.\\n    - ineffective.\\n    - both are extremely effective at catching crunchy food bits and litter, and cleanup is as easy as a quick shake and spray with the hose outside not that the spray is always necessary - my pair are rather neat in their habits.\\n    - effective and cheap.\\n    - its really incredible how this industry can make so much money off of mens insecurities and products that 100% of the time have 0% results.\\n    - a very effective product.\\n    - very good,and effective.\\n    - i will try it for another week or two before giving up, but the results have not been on par with the other positive reviews.\\n    - the tan will develope in about 2-3 hours, so dont worry if you dont see imidiate results.\\n    - i have rated it with three stars since i have not used it long enough to see any significant results and because if it is true that the head is only supposed to be used once unlike razors that are used several times until the blades are dull, then the heads should be made so that they can be used more than once and several heads should be included in the kit.\\n    - they work perfectly and always give me results that feel consistent and accurate based on how many carbs i have had in the last few days.\\n    - previously, i would heat a small pan of milk to obtain similar results.\\n    - this is an effective massager for percussion however i did .\\n    - excellent for skin especially mature i bought this oil after realizing some of the most expensive and effective skincare products come with sea buckthorn berry oil.\\n    - the pill looks the same, but you definately do not get the same results.\\n    - this results in the food staying in the holding bin area.\\n    - beano worked well for me for about a year, but its effectiveness wore off after that.\\n    - it seems to clean my contacts effectively, and leaves them feeling very moist.\\n    - thats good enough results for me.\\n    - l-lysine powder is more effective than in tablet form.\\n    - i ended up buying a sportdog brand training collar and it was much more effective.\\n    - while they did help a little, they were just as effective as peppermint altoids which are cheaper.\\n    - i do not believe this product lived up to it   i do not believe this product lived up to it reputation or at least to the videos ive seen on line, but im willing to give it some more time to see if it will work as it intended to to lighten the skin.\\n    - i guess this is not to bad for the price, but i am going to try a different brand next time to see about durability.\\n    - it is a very effective product for not very frequent constipation cases.and even vary safe for daly use, however natural solutions are always the best.\\n    - i cannot vouch that it killed every flea on our dog, but the chemical seems very effective, and our large dog didnt seem to have any ill effects.the price is very reasonable!\\n    - here i had better results.\\n    - hii am writing this review after using this product.it is working but making noise.heating function is not that good/effective.i did massage 2-3 time its give you some rest but the way massager should work its not up to the mark.\\n    - waitin for results.\\n    - nice scent smells nice and is more cost effective than cologne.\\n    - very effective and easy to swallow, i also realized that i got very much energy which is great.\\n    - ive used numerous over the counter whitening kits and have had so so results.\\n    - works better than i antcipated i just started using this product but have had some remarkable results.\\n    - i use this now in conjunction with the hair laser brush and results seem to be better than propecia after 5 months.\\n    - i run mine for only 24hrs weekly and is effective.\\n    - will purchase more and hope for similar results!\\n    - i like that it is sturdy, flat and effective, and not plastic.\\n    - i have tried other eye creams that worked great but had no lasting results or are no longer on the market.\\n    - this effectively cleared up my newborns dry skin.\\n    - i would much rather use a purely natural product like this over chemical based ones, but it wasnt very effective.\\n    - so, i stopped buying them and have been searching for more cost-effective runner-up for a decade still trying.they have the right shallow taper, not like the howard leight hl ones with the stupid flare-out at the end which prevents them from going in far enough and actually seem to make them want to pull themselves out.\\n    - vibrate mode is effective!.\\n    - just needed to have lab work done for surgery and was holding my breath waiting for the results.\\n    - unfortunately, sometimes serums have to be heavier to be effective.\\n    - it is handsomely designed as well as effective.\\n    - very effective.\\n    - doctors brushpicks i have been using doctors brushpicks for a few years with excelent results.\\n    - good product for you who say it does not work you might expect amazing results on one go when it is not true, apply about 2-4 times throughout a week of application and take it easy on the oily foods remember to wash face daily and you will see results.\\n    - the product is easy to use and has minimal, but decent results.\\n    - this is a very effective product!\\n    - so effective, convenient, and pleasant tasting.\\n    - they are comfortable, practical and very effective.\\n    - i went through the whole package just about with the same results, i will probably throw the rest away.\\n    - convenient, healthy not too strong but strong enough to be effective.\\n    - ive been using hikari excel for a while and have great results.\\n    - i tried several different vitamins but never had any results until i started using hairomega 3-in -1. my hair is growing and i also see new growth from using hairomega 3-in-1 dht blocking.\\n    - results - hair started thinning again.\\n    - i was actually shocked when i got my results back, as i had such high hopes at lowering my thyroid medication.\\n    - we have two watches that these batteries fit and it is more cost effective to order on amazon than to run to the store every time we need a battery.\\n    - if you stay with it, this can be effective.\\n    - for my purposes, i prefer the sodium bentonite and have no use for the latter, which isnt a lesser quality clay, but isnt as effective at absorbing the toxins and gunk from my skin as the sodium bentonite.\\n    - an important note to potential buyers however, is that one must thoroughly train the dog prior to using this collar in order for it to be effective.\\n    - i have used this tanning lotion before when i paid full price and it worked than, i always seen results instantly.\\n    - i use it in addition to phytoceramides with phenomenal results!!!\\n    - results do not occur overnight for most people.\\n    - when i started getting results they were awesome!\\n    - maybe that is why my results are so fast.\\n    - i use cetaphil cleanser and i have also used a exfoliator scrub with the brush and the results were immediate.\\n    - hoping for good results!.\\n    - the first level made my dog jump when he felt it, which is not what you want, and only had ot use level 2 when he was super amped.in short i received the educator and i now have positive results with my dog.\\n    - works ok, not as effective as i was hoping for though.\\n    - i have ordered and received my second bottle so that would let you know that i very pleased with the results.\\n    - i use them with my contour usb to be able to monitor and download my results to my laptop.\\n    - i love the tap with your finger to see your daily results.\\n    - very effective!.\\n    - ive been using it for about a month now and ive seen great results.\\n    - the shea butter is a great product, but i feel you can get the same results with any regular lotion.\\n    - the shape of the handle is effective and easy to grasp.\\n    - i have tried other teeth whitening products before and have never seen such fast and clear results like i do with this product.\\n    - i have taken a variety of test boosters with good results.\\n    - it goes fast i did not realize you have to stock up on these things to get results.it was no problem to order.\\n    - a few months, great results, smooth clean energy, no jitters, but i do only take one a day, purchased from other websites, that were more expensive, never again,fast delivery too,\\n    - early results arrived very quickly.\\n    - we used it on three different kinds of fur and it was very effective.\\n    - i think it will be much more effective when used in the shower since the hot water will open up my pores even further.\\n    - below are my results ambient ~72 deg f, test location  center of devicetemp.\\n    - fantastic item so far, have to see how long heating element works.\\n    - i saw a bit of difference in my eating habits also i stopped using lots if sugar which is a good for me.been using the restroom a lot and drinking lots of water.however i only started using this product for two weeks and had to stop because of doctors orders.i am presently seeking treatment for pregnancy.i did saw a change in my sugar cravings and really did not want to eat as much.i am sure if you continue to take this product as advise you will get great results.\\n    - almay night concentrate anecdotally effective i dont know for certain about any scientific studies showing that kinetin night concetrate is effective against aging/wrinkles.\\n    - mixed results.\\n    - i got no results from this product.\\n    - i have tried other soaps with poor results.\\n    - the drink is effective as far as its performance boost but the flavor is bleh.\\n    - overall i am not impressed with the price of this product versus the results.\\n    - but once i had taken it regularly for about a week i started to see markable results.\\n    - i gave the product 3 stars as an overall rating, it wouldnt get any if it was based on effectiveness.\\n    - this one; however, is completely ineffective.\\n    - i use this product along with a natural shampoo with biotin and a potent herbal blend and the results are amazing!<br /><br />thicker, lusher, strong hair after just 3 weeks of using it.<br /><br />now, after 3 months, i still see improvements.<br /><br />i think this formula is great for those wanting the ease of all the great vitamins in one bottle.<br /><br />however, you can probably find each of these vitamins, minerals elsewhere in food source or individual vitamin supplements.\\n    - made me think, no matter, how hard or for how long, i used this epilator - my hair were just saying &34;catch me if you can&34; and xtweeze, just gave up.\\n    - i didnt really have great or noticible results with that one.\\n    - it arrived 8 days later and we tried it out and wow does it work great!<br /><br />it is slightly darker than the st tropez and it goes on just as easy and is streak free.\\n    - high expectations, but disappointing results first, i have to say that the manufacturers choosing not to have printed instructions on the product was an odd choice to make, in that it forces people to come to sites like amazon in order to find out how much to apply, how long to leave the product on, etc.\\n    - it is very effective.\\n    - this was okay but did not deliver results comparable to intesol.\\n    - my baby is now 3 months old, i tried drinking milkmaid tea three times a day with no results.\\n    - i was so beside myself with how effective it was, i had to come write a review.\\n    - what can i say my wife is very please with the product it is very effective for the use it is intended for\\n    - my pores are much cleaner and i am seeing better results from my facial night moisturizer.\\n    - over time this results in static when you turn the dial and eventually entire ranges of the volume spectrum become an open circuit and dont operate.\\n    - .on my second bottle and love the results\\n    - very effective as an immune system booster!\\n    - ill update my review if i get some good results.\\n    - it is a predictable, natural and beautiful color and results.\\n    - most reviews from another site offering this product lauded miraculous results using bm tone-up.\\n    - very pleased with the results of my first attempt at making lotion.\\n    - we began feeding her this product and soon saw good results.\\n    - it is non-greasy, requires very little to be effective and has a nice lemony scent.\\n    - no significant results.\\n    - i just wouldnt completely rely on the results it gives.\\n    - like others have said, a very nice looking and effective unit.\\n    - i used the mucinex on my daughter and saw results after a few days.\\n    - the extra money ive spent on the food has been very cost effective.\\n    - excellent brush for thick, knotty hair i have very thick, knotty hair and this comb is gentle and effective!\\n    - im excited to update my review once ive had time to see the product work\\n    - i will see how long this lasts me.\\n    - however, i found that if i use just a tiny bit the results are okay.\\n    - instant results.\\n    - im not having much pain in my knees at all now and thats all that matters to me.if you buy this stuff, dont expect quick results and you may want to start by taking 2 capsules, twice a day for a week.\\n    - it should come with a warning and a can of mace, it is so effective at attracting men!\\n    - i received this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review and im glad i did, so far im very pleased with the results im seeing.\\n    - i have begun a regimen of taking nad supplements within the past year and most of them have been effective at providing a bit of a boost in energy in the morning.\\n    - beautiful results!\\n    - obviously one knows what to do with a face cream, but it’s always nice to have guidance on the packaging for a new product, like how much to use, etc.<br /><br />all in all i would recommend this product to people who are happy to pay for an effective and luxurious cream.\\n    - when ive got ample time on my hands, i apply the gel, then use compression wraps to enhance the results; at night, i used aggressive but not painful, massage techniques, especially to the thighs and stomach to make sure that the products absorbs well into my skin.\\n    - small but effective.\\n    - i really cant score this a 5 yet because i havent seen results yet but i do know that this product does give me the energy that i need to give me that extra push while im working out, i also know that this product doesnt give me jitters like other products i used in the past.\\n    - very, very effective and i couldnt be happier my neighbors too.\\n    - great results.\\n    - while the writer, dr. kaayla daniel, is clearly angered by the results found and lets this come through a red flag for me when reading a supposedly scientific document - i do feel good questions are raised.\\n    - amazing results im 55 years old, live on the beach and have since a child.\\n    - have been using this for a while a great product always effective\\n    - the material on this pet hammock seat cover is thinner than some other brands ive tried, but still effective at shielding seats from dirt/mud/vomit.\\n    - this by far this was the most ineffective of them all.\\n    - i also found them to be too short to be effective.\\n    - i personally love the fact that it has proven results with reducing acne flare-ups and also help smooth fine lines all without over drying the skin.\\n    - the gentlest, most effective makeup remover ive ever used!\\n    - i didnt think anything of it until i started using it and found no results from this bottle.\\n    - my wool jacket has coarse wool, so no issue with the results.\\n    - sensitivity is ineffective.\\n    - so you have to be a big careful where you hold it, and if you rush it, the results arent worth the effort.\\n    - this, along with therapeutic massage by a certified professional massage therapist has helped me deal very effectively with pain .without drugs!\\n    - i am pleased with the results.\\n    - its good love it, already seeing some results after 3 weeks of using it.\\n    - i will continue to update this review and post my long-term results.\\n    - very effective and physician recommended.\\n    - i get the best results when i use it before i go to bed having showered in the morning.\\n    - looking forward to my results after the second month\\n    - it stays on for a little while but eventually turns itself off i have no idea how long it stays on, my guess is maybe a half hour after the final light setting is reached, which i like.\\n    - hsrd to tell its effectiveness.\\n    - tried it and got excellent results.\\n    - hope that i see rapid hair growth results and hope that it helps regrowt my damaged edges  i like the consistency  not to liquidy yet not to stiff like grease.\\n    - proactive didnt even come close to achieving the same results.\\n    - i really think its effective and a legit good product, not expensive, and does its job.\\n    - the results were better than expected.\\n    - affordable and effective.\\n    - however, this must be done once every day or two to be effective.\\n    - the results were perfect.\\n    - great product ive been using testosterone booster since june and i can feel the difference, more energy and more resistance than normal but you have to be compromised with a healthy life style on order to see full results.\\n    - very pleased with the results!.\\n    - its the best that ive used without going to get a chemical peel from a professional plus none of the after affects just great results.\\n    - a physician suggested that we give this product a try and we have been using it for over a year with great results!\\n    - this is the very best, it has the most amount per tablet that i have seen and it seems to be very effective.\\n    - i noticed results after the first time i used it.\\n    - this product is more pricey than the standard line ovulation test kits, but it beats guessing your results with taking your basil temperature or using the cheaper kits.\\n    - my daughters hair had the same results.\\n    - and, let me say, not only does this design effectively keep the dog at heel, it is very humane because they are guided rather than forced to do so.\\n    - i used it for a period of 4 weeks with no other ear meds or ear cleaners and so i am still looking for an effective medicine for chronic ear infections that really works.\\n    - i tried most of the cruelty free dishwasher detergent with bad results.\\n    - i wish this shampoo was a lot less expensive, but i cannot complain about the results.\\n    - i have a few api test kits and i get consistent results.\\n    - i have gotten many friends and family members using this shampoo now and they all love the results.\\n    - but im really wanting results in my hair the real reason i purchased these.\\n    - results with the vet always seem to be, it could be this or this or that.\\n    - i also used it as a facial and was pleased with the results.\\n    - love this stuff love this stuff, i have been using it for about a month and im seeing great results!\\n    - amazing results!\\n    - i since have ordered several bottles and shared some of them for friends and family members and they all had similar results.\\n    - we are both happy with the results and would advice anyone who is concerned with his cardiovascular health to try the coq-10 supplement.\\n    - its ok. this is not as effective in keeping the bugs away from my dogs face as i had hoped.\\n    - it requires thoughtful reading, organization and a willingness to experiment but i believe these results are more rewarding and the process more interesting and engaging.i have placed this review on each of the items i have ordered from bulk supplements as i will only give my personal opinion on products i have direct experience with.disclosure  i did receive a free sample of cla from bulk supplements.\\n    - this has been the least invasive and most effective way of helping her face heal.\\n    - did not work as expected ive used this product for about 3 weeks and has not produced any results.\\n    - does it work?.\\n    -

the texture when you first buy the sponges is hard-ish but once you wet them they transform into a bouncy texture that just makes make up application fun again.\\n    - great when used with special blend.\\n    -

it looks nice, its durable our puppy chewed right through the soft-sided crate that we use in the car and easy to clean.\\n    - and finally i like the little door that locks on it because im short so it would be hard for me or kids to bend over the walls of the cage to get the pet so you just open the door and they can let there selfs out.\\n    -

my pt uses them herself & recommended them.\\n    - i thought it would be a cool kit to take on our vacations as we spend a lot of time in the great outdoors.anyhow, in that kit was a small bottle of this all in one wash. it was too small to take on vacation for my entire family to use, so over the past couple of weeks i have been using it periodically in my home shower.i have lived in michigan all my life and we also almost exclusively vacation within our state.\\n    - this is the best price that ive found ive used this product for over 20 years.\\n    - they absorb the urine unlike some of the pads we have used previously so no run off.\\n    - luckily, it can be removed, and you can use the slot it goes into to hang it on a nail if its near a wall.\\n    -

the way to keep your mouth with the proper ph balance is to use baking soda along with toothpaste when you brush.\\n    - the thing is huge, plenty big for two cats, also i had absolutely no issue with attaching the two pieces together so either the company perfected that flaw or we have some folks reviewing this product who’ve never ever owned a set of legos idk but anywho it took zero coxing to get my cat to use it, and beware if you have a very active inquisitive cat they may eat the leaves or fake filler stuff i have a siamese and he loves to play with the filler.\\n    -

the restore wound cleaner was used daily for 3 weeks and we did not have to open the new bottles i ordered to continue treatment.\\n    - pros  -pump - i prefer pumps over tubes - it looks nicer, easier to use, takes up less room on the counter -lasts a long time - i think it can last longer than the tube - which could help justify the cost neutral  -gel consistency when it comes out - it foams up quickly - i havent used the non-iso in a long time, but thinking about it -

if i get stiff during the day i use the roller and the pain lightens up.\\n    - because the ramp folds so that the traction/top side is outtermost, that means you have to unfold the ramp on the ground and then lift it up onto the van.\\n    -

i used this for years and liked it.\\n    - i do use a green tint primer first to minimum redness.i brush the foundation on and it evens out my skin tone beautifully.\\n    - so if you see those on the reviews, they no longer apply.the products seem great, but ive had so much trouble buying the damn product on amazon, i cannot recommend anyone else does it.\\n    - i was fuming and fusing at him that he cost us money, because i had to purchase another one because of his strong-armed grip.\\n    - definitely the best diapers i have used.\\n    - i also told a friend about it and she used it on her rabbits ears that had sores from the rabbit itching them so much and she said within a short amount of time the sores started healing up and eventually the ears went back to normal with no itching or sores.\\n    - it does work to wear away at the calluses, but it is not enough power to truly achieve beautiful feet.\\n    - ive got thin and slightly longer hair my winter cut, so i used this after showering and blow drying my hair, just to see what it does.\\n    - the first 3 days that i used it, it dried up my pimples and after a week of using it i noticed that my skin is brighter, supple and smooth.<br />unlike other brands or serum its not greasy or feeling like its heavy when you applied it, its fast absorbing and its very light and you will notice the difference after you applied it into your face and neck.<br />i highly recommend this product!!\\n    - i used hemp seed butter in both my lock wax and pomade and my hair is soft, shiny and full of life.\\n    - based upon the overwhelmingly positive reviews, i decided to give it a try.it works.im a skeptic at heart, but when used as directed, it totally and completely got rid of the pain, ache, and sensitivity in my elbows that made it extremely uncomfortable to lift weights, drive, or use the computer.im purchasing more as soon as i finish this review.\\n    - however, now we see many different uses for it.\\n    - meh  the nail polish strips were graphically interesting, but one package only contained enough for one hand thankfully i purchased two packs and i used 1/2 of the second after opening the first and discovering only 8 strips.\\n    - it takes a little bit to sink in, but when it does, i cannot tell whether i used eye cream or not.\\n    - i was recommended this collar to help with my dogs insane barking whenever i left the house.\\n    - a little goes a long way, youll want to use this night and day.\\n    - will use them again.\\n    - yes they have an odor but i use them at night or after a workout/physical activity where i am going to shower after eventually so it has never bothered me.\\n    - it was recommended by his professional hairstylist and is the product she uses.\\n    - i just bought natures miracle advanced ultra on sale at petsmart, 100pads for $39 which is a great price but i only use these in my crate due to that high price and for visit at friends houses.\\n    - its easy to use and efficient.\\n    - i currently use other supplements but this by far seems to be the one daily vitamin for me.\\n    - it is just what i wanted to give my son as a house warming gift for his new home!\\n    - for longer days i might reapply.\\n    - didnt work as i expected but i only used it once.\\n    - i have rosacea skin and it does not cause any redness.\\n    - be carefull i do love this brush and its concept of adding more body and shine but i gave it a 4 star because while the barrel is turning you have to make sure it doesnt roll in the cracks and pull your hair.\\n    - i was very happy to find something else i could use to scrub my kitchen and bathroom without that heavy mop.\\n    - it feels nice, goes on smoothly but then so does my moisturizer which i apply over the top of the cover girl/olay simply ageless serum primer.\\n    - the senior dog i purchased it for feels a dog bed is better than using those stairs, but the other dog loves the stairs and uses them daily.\\n    - i ordered these because i tried a set with yin-yangs that looked similar.\\n    - i use it on a daily basis and have had no issues with the pumps which is a big for me.\\n    - i used to use my tooth brush then i got an oral-b battery brush and did not like that on my tongue.\\n    - i use this on my pomeranian who has a ton of long fur .\\n    - he wanted to use ultra sound treatments which didnt,t help, and actually made the pain worse.\\n    - after applying several other products that didnt seem to work, used this where the vet had scraped a little too deeply at our pups mange and say an immediate improvement in healing and hair growth\\n    - the core isnt smaller - it fits fine on my old paper towel holder - there are fewer towels per roll than i was used to, which makes sense, based on the price.\\n    - i bought this from amazon because of the price.\\n    - i use it for myself.\\n    - for this reason alone, i have taken away a star, and thought about taking away two stars -comes out fast when full - you just have to get used to it -hard to get toothpaste out when running low - you may think that you are out - but keep pressing and you will get a lot more paste to come out -thats why i mentioned in the pros that it lasts a long time -unable to see the fill level - the only way i can tell if im about out is to note how light the can is the design of this tube is horrible, however, obviously its not holding me back from continuing to purchase it again and again ; i cant say whether iso does anything extra for me as far as cleaning and whitening.\\n    - i bought this light for my proflex sump for the refugium because it was a perfect fit.\\n    - all three cats use it  pampered princess, fussy tabby, even our blind senior.\\n    - i  would  not  recommend because of  its  price and  lackluster.\\n    - i am planning on trying the sonicdisc on the windy days when the lighter disc get blown too far off course.two stars because the disc is soft and safer than the hard plastic frisbees but it does not fly well enough and does not seem to be durable.\\n    - my hamster doesnt use it.\\n    - the piece if paper tells you what you can do with it but doesnt tell you how to use it e.g 1 tbs for laundry etc.\\n    - use to love but not anymore.\\n    - this is not just because of the crazy price but also because i like it and it works for me.\\n    - happy to have amazons price and hve used it for years..happy to have amazons price and ailing\\n    - i will not recommand them at night because they leak, my son sleeps 12 hours per night.\\n    - very useful .\\n    - honestly, just because something is phallic shaped and vibrates does not mean it is qualified to do the job.\\n    - this was not the unit that i thought i was going to get when i ordered it, none of mine can get on the topmost platform because there is not enough room to jump from.\\n    - i end up changing the litter much more frequently than i used to, not less.\\n    - but ill purchase again just because i like the color and the fact that its a retractable pen.\\n    - wish i had used this earlier!.\\n    - i originally bought this to use while i was away on vacation.\\n    - yes they are low cost considering, but no other florescent bulbs i use, even more often, burn out as fast.\\n    - the collars appear to hold a charge for 3+ days, but we really only correct a few times a day now because they caught on so quickly.update system is about 16 months old now and one of the collars just failed.it now immediately shuts off as soon as i remove it from the charger.\\n    - the strips are easy to use and seem to be fairly accurate.\\n    - will continue to use and monitor results.\\n    - this doesnt just apply to the elderly.\\n    - my girl used this and really didnt change anythingwaste of money\\n    - i used this starightener for the first time this morning and im completely satisfied with it!\\n    - we have a cat who continues to mark the corners of 3 rooms in our house, we have tried many, many treatments and so far this is far and away the most effective.\\n    - they should read the label carefully because there is a major difference between the two.\\n    - falls apart brush falls apart after a few uses.\\n    - i typically run the diffuser for no less than four hours and, at the end of that time, the scent of the oil is only slightly weak.\\n    - i now use these wipes preventatively about once per week and they work very, very well.\\n    - ill keep looking for better ones ill admit i havent used these before but the one color i liked the most with my hair color broke after one use.\\n    - it is the best dog brush we have ever used.\\n    - worth it and shipped promptly!definitely the best sanitizer i have used.\\n    - this is my second one because i wore the first one out.\\n    - after watching my friend use this to brush a wad of loose fur from her boxer, a dog that i didnt know even needed brushing, i knew i had to have this.\\n    - the 3 from the same parents are a little pack and refuse to accept the other cat.\\n    - im pretty pale and i use the color nude beige.\\n    - i use these with my tens unit so i dont have to replace the sticky patches.\\n    -

the zipper is terrible and broke after only a few uses , very disappointedthe bag just looks cool l\\n    - i only have 3 days applying this product and i really like it!\\n    - i bought these wipes because i had heard good reviews on youtube.\\n    - it is a pleasure to hold and use on the hair and scalp.\\n    - good quality easy to use.\\n    - i intend to continue to use this product to make shakes twice a day.\\n    - ive used countless products geared toward thinning fine hair and this duo is a keeper!\\n    - in fact, im almost worried that i will lose it some day because ill forget it on a piece of clothing.\\n    - i have used this product before and it is amazing!\\n    - like it it is hard for me to review hair products because hair is visual and tactile.\\n    - it is a bit greasy so i only use it at night but it is definitely worth it.\\n    - now we dont even use it at the door.\\n    - have moved it to two houses now.always find a place that it serves our purpose which is keeping the dogs out of the cat box and cat food!\\n    - our buddy bowl cracked after eight years of heavy use; i immediately started searching for a replacement.\\n    - we use a medicated shampoo that helps for everyday use but sometimes well get a super dry patch that she shampoo does not help with.\\n    - very easy to use.\\n    - great product for oily and sensitive skin i love this lotion, gentle and does not cause pimples.\\n    - the batteries seem to work well, and the remaining battery was clearly unused, it was just a bit odd.\\n    - used this lead last night in my first obedience class.\\n    - they are great towels to use during workouts.\\n    - had learned how to pop out screens so we could not leave windows open in the house and this arrangement makes all the difference in their experiencing sounds and smells outside.however we never leave them alone outside as there are cats roaming from adjacent houses plus we have a raccoon family that comes around every evening and morning.\\n    - absolutely.<br />i chose to buy this, even after reading some of the more negative reviews, because i figured its low price tag was worth the risk.\\n    - i used these to teach my girl the rolling trick in 2 training session.\\n    - she did say that she was not as comfortable in it for long periods of time and felt like it gave less back support then her hefty wheelchair that she uses in the house.\\n    - she uses it a little differently than what is described on the product.\\n    - i sleep on my side and found laying my arm across my body to rest on the mattress was painful because the kush is too firm.\\n    - works well, but hard to use if not familair with this type of iron works well and all but has no plastic tip and the part that is suppose to keep your hair in place on the rod doesnt have a spring.\\n    - i have used these on three dogs over 15 years.\\n    - amazing top coat i never really understood the point of a top coat until i used seche vite - the reason being that my previous top coat polishes were worthless!\\n    - and my little girl is very happy too, she uses it as her bed also.\\n    - i know it has a lot of great benifits, but no matter how much essential oils i use in my body butter to cover the smell of the shea butter, i can never quite cover up or get past that funky smell \\n    - also use umka cold liquid; boiron oscillococcinum flu & chestal cough; vicks vapocream on foot soles/chest; astragalus herb; & young living therapeutic-grade medicinal plant extracts aka essential oils.\\n    - im saving a fortune on pet wipes because she no longer gets urine on her paws!\\n    - it scrubs residue from pipe and rinses off easily with soap and water to reuse over and over again.\\n    - i love the packaging because they stay moist.\\n    - not nearly as big or deep as i had imagined.does not hold much water because most of the size/weight is just the border/bottom of the bowl.the bowl itself is shallow!\\n    - i used a jig saw for the wood door, but a reciprocating saw for the exterior fire door because it was metal.\\n    - easier to apply.\\n    - i have ordered online and purchased in stores i cant tell you how many of these harness type halters for my little 4lb pomeranian and finally this one fits her and she even dips her head into for me because she knows now it is so comfortable to wear and she gets to go outside and play without the lease chocking her when we are walking or when i have her tied up for a short time outside.\\n    - didnt notice any real difference after the first use of a full bottle, so i tried another.didnt get anything out of it.\\n    - i have used this product for a shiba inu who is scratching and nipping all the time.\\n    - will not order again i have used it as directed but as of yet have i seen any improvement.\\n    - heat styling causes hair to lose lipids oils, as does coloring, and this mist helps to replenish them.\\n    - when you insert a lens, slide one end of the lens under a tab and then apply gentle pressure to the frame near the other tab such that the second tab gets farther away from the first.\\n    - i only use the white scrub about once a week although it recommends to use it every day.\\n    - i used a tiny drop, rubbed between both hands, on my dry, flyaway from static electricity bangs and crown of my already styled hair, and the flyaways laid right down without making my hair greasy.\\n    - was previously a safeway dogfood user.\\n    - my dog is used to using pee pads on a tray.\\n    - it does take a couple weeks for you and your face to get used to the razor, but that just means that the shave wont be as close as it can be the first week or two.\\n    - just use it to buff foundation and powder all over your face.\\n    - theres one setting on-off.this uses 3 aaa batteries, which are included, so you can load this up and use it right out of the box.this also works fine with my generic rechargeable aaas.as the description states, this has a multitude of uses.\\n    - i have used gilette before but this is my new replacement for the gilette that i used to use\\n    - i was amazed at the multifunction it has hooked!<br /><br />i have an allergy to acetone , it makes the sides of thumbs peel.<br />when i got a sample of these, i was amazed at the multifunction it has.<br /><br />nothing but these for me now.<br />do not hesitate to purchase  ,  the smell is so nice<br /><br />if you wear 3 coats of red or dark polish u will use double fyi<br />i wear nude colors  so its easy for me.\\n    - we have 3 different sized people int he house and do not have this problem.\\n    - i usually have to use a detangler first and then put in the leave-in conditioner.\\n    - we used the monitor religiously for 7 months and still nothing was happening.\\n    - yes it works omg i love this stuff<br />heres something a lot of folks may not know.<br />magnesium sulfate, which is the main ingredient in epsom salts, is the same thing used<br />to prevent women from going into premature labor.\\n    - and reading the bottle is second only to having a safe, gentle, sweet smelling soap that can be used for many purposes.\\n    - it is such a better price here i used to buy this through my hair dresser at the salon.\\n    - coco used to get an occasional tick even with the oral flea and tick meds.\\n    - i only use it when needed.just recently i noticed my female cat was trying to urinate every 5 minutes.\\n    - based on other reviews, i was worried it might not work, and i did have a problem for one second during first use until i realized the battery that came in the unit had been placed inside backwards, probably to save power.\\n    - i have to use certain facial lotions or i break out im in my later 30s, not a teen.\\n    - the product is great when used like it is meant to.\\n    - i would use this collar only as a night visual aid, not as an actual walking collar.\\n    - i put towels down on the floor and covering the sink while i am applying it so that i dont make a mess of my bathroom.\\n    - some birds might prefer the pellets ground up almost to a powder form and they will ingest them like a sprinkled topping until they get used to the taste.3 many pet birds like fruit juices, so try mixing a little juice with the pellets, but not too much to make them soggy.you may come up with a different solution for your own bird, but do not give up on the idea of pellets.\\n    - i use the vivid white day in the daytime and vivid white night at night.\\n    - rather, the velcro is used for retention of attachments.\\n    - it is mostly user friendly, but not completely.\\n    - it uses a single pin which will probably wear out after repeated chargings, at least that has been my experience with other connections of the type.\\n    - i find that my eyes thank me for changing out my mascara every three months and when i begin to use a new tube, my sensitive eyes give a sigh of relief.<br /><br />i have used all the mascaras out there and need to switch around after several years of using one product because my eyes tend to develop a sensitivity to that product.\\n    - we have switched him over to this kennel in the house and he is used to it already.\\n    - these totally prevented that.but, they arent the easiest things to get on and off and they are hot for the dog because their feet cant breathe.\\n    - we cannot seem to keep them in the house long enough- they literally just get devoured.\\n    - and i love the curved tips which make it much safer to use.good quality.\\n    - drop down arm will make it useful if either of us becomes bedridden.\\n    - california baby vs. badger stick review i prefer this to the california baby sunscreen stick because it is easier to apply.\\n    - you might want to try mashing the shreds together with a fork to make it more like a pate until your cat gets used to it.\\n    - definitely something to get used to, but i liked it.<br /><br />i looove this brand when dying hair, so i will definitely stick with it!\\n    - this is an easy to use and easy to clean product.\\n    - i kept my old scoop and just use that one for the smaller chunks.\\n    - - its not that hard once you get used to it.\\n    - if you have sensitive skin, do not use this product!\\n    - i have used this product every day and have no problems with irritation or skin roughness.\\n    - its neat that you can close it up when not in use.\\n    - we intend to buy another because he is a little bigger than dwarfs but he still appears to like the cage and has settled in nicely!\\n    - am still learning proper application but can definitely see an improvement in my skin.\\n    - it does leave a slight metallic aftertaste, but its not bad enough to be bothersome and you either get used to it or it goes away after long term use.\\n    - one of the best i have used so far.highly recomended.\\n    - however, as far as whitening goes, i dont really think it works because as soon as you stop using the soap, your skin returns to its previous state.\\n    - this was thrown away after one use.\\n    - do not do that because it leaves hideous dried rings around the edges of where the liquid was working.4. i had to go back in with small applications at the rings to remove them.\\n    - i used to feed my cats sheba a while back and am glad to see its available again.\\n    - he did but, again, the litter tray is too shallow, and i couldnt scoop in because it was all over the bottom, stuck around all the rings.\\n    - where it really came in handy with the dog was in her bath, as you can use it to lather up.\\n    - shes been worried about when she walks the dog at night because there are no street lights on her street.\\n    - it is a nice quality and great fit for my bean pillow.i only gave it 4 stars because i thought it was a little too expensive and besides that, it needs to be ironed.\\n    - so its been in use approximately 4 months and it barely holds a charge longer than the one i replaced it with.\\n    - keep in mind that this article is written with examples of potential holiday pet-related disasters, so the use of uncle ralph and the diabetic candy is simply an example of how a xylitol induced life-threatining situation could occur.the seemingly harmless sugar-free red and white mints you bought for your diabetic uncle ralph can cause life-threatening problems for fido if the mints contain xylitol.\\n    - it is an economical price for the size, i like the dropper stopper to control the amount that you use, it has a nice consistency, it is easily absorbed and works either alone or under makeup.\\n    - but i do want to say i have learned not to drink acohol, or beer while on this system because it will slow down the weight loss process drasticly.\\n    - this product works well, but do not confuse it as being similar with the dog pills that are once a month, this will only last a several hours.\\n    - doesnt seem to cause a bad reaction with my two gs mixes.\\n    - they dont use it to scratch as much as they use it as a rest.\\n    - i got this toner in a travel size as part of a gift box years ago and loved how well it evened out my skin, i have never used another product that worked this well or this quickly.\\n    - i think how you use it is key.\\n    - i dont have any real evidence to support my next statement, but our aquarium just seems healthier when we use this versus other brands.\\n    - i cant imagine putting a medium sized dog in there, that is very cruel.if you are to put a medium sized dog in there use the largest cage.\\n    - i could only wear the product around the house because i couldnt wear shoes while using the sole angel product.\\n    - ive only used it once so far but it seemed to work well.\\n    - even if it did excel in those areas, who the heck wants to scrub up with a product that smells like a michigan outhouse?\\n    -   to essential oils use but i will be having fun using all the pieces this set came in am new to essential oils use but i will be having fun using all the pieces this set came in.\\n    - pump ball is of low quality does not get any suction at all and insertion hole of shaft extremly small and hard to even use, gave up on it and may go to trash\\n    - i found that the only way to really get it down to their skin really well was to use some electric clippers to shave a small spot on the back of the shoulders/neck area.\\n    - their were to many, do not use this because   their were to many, do not use this because off dark spots are dark skin, so we sent it back.\\n    - during wwi, it was used to dress wounds, because of its antibacterial qualities.\\n    - it didnt seem like it was, because it made such neat little clumps in the teeth, but it was!\\n    - i was able to use the handle to get myself to my feet with my dogs help.the vest is also very professional looking and eye catching.\\n    - some people use bleach, others like to use vinegar.\\n    - this detergent cleans well and hasnt caused any skin irritations in the 3+ years i have been using it.\\n    - compared to other test boosters i have used in the past i believe that this one has shown the most results.\\n    -

fun and easy to use did the job and cute, too!\\n    - to this day its still used extensively in chinese and indian ayer vedic medicine.\\n    - i realize thats a packaging issue to take up with the mfger, but you should know that when it arrives, you might need some help handling it.<br /><br />also, in actual use as a portable ramp, its not as easy to set up as it should be.\\n    - the 1mm is a good general length to get if you are getting only one size as it can still be used in sensitive areas, just a bit more gently.\\n    - i have used this for years and continue to love it.\\n    - i had planned to use these collapsible bowls in the cars and so far my schnauzer likes drinking out of them and theyre easy to use and store.\\n    - i use in conjunction with the miracle worker mouisturizer and it sinks right in and plumps the skin.\\n    - please make sure to have a drink of water handy because they do dry your mouth and throat right after eating them.\\n    - watch out though because they run out of .\\n    - too thick to conceal ive only used 2 brands of hydrocolloid patches for acne, this one and the smartmed cover-dots, and this one is my least favorite of the two.\\n    - excellent product - have used it before - works great on minor skin irritations, scratches, etc.\\n    - return it but we did not, you must wear glove to protect yourself before use it, or may make your skin .turn red and itchy\\n    - i bought it used and saved over $15.\\n    - alas, this is much smaller than that brush, but much too big to use for eyeshadow.\\n    - dangerous there was a piece of glass in mine, it cuts my thigh, i am glad it wasnt my 2 years old daughter that i cut because i use it on her also.\\n    - my german shepard is terrified of storms and so i tried this after much hesitation because it seemed to good to be true.\\n    - i also agree that it has a great scent, and very pleasant to use, as well as a strong cleaner for other surfaces, but thats about it.\\n    - about 30 minutes ago i used one to remove my normal make up that i wear and my face is on fire and is redder than a tomato.\\n    - i will continue to use it because my skin has had no outbreaks since ive started using it!\\n    - i only used a small package of the honest diapers for newborns so i cant say much about them except those diapers were very stiff and way to large to fit a 6lb newborn.\\n    - my daughter also likes this fragrance, and she usually does not like any fragrances i use.<br />excellent service.\\n    - plus, you can use non-dairy milk i use soy and toss in mix-ins.\\n    - if you arent used to the taste or want to add a tad more flavor to it, add organic peanut butter or almond butter to it.\\n    - the only wear visible is some minor water softener build-up.<br /><br />--update 2/27/14-- a few months ago oct13, after daily use, i had a problem with the silver backing of the mirror flaking off.\\n    - great brush i use this to do french tip on myself by dipping it in alcohol and swiping the line clean and it works wonderfully.\\n    - meanwhile, the tooth gloss -- a grayish color to begin with -- broke off during its first application.\\n    - i used it to make natural shsnoop and it worked well.\\n    - it has rolling teeth in the comb that easily remove tangles - must be used however every day or every other day.\\n    - bought them to use for a lip look.\\n    - here is my thoughts    cons    - it is harder to use than your average curling iron.\\n    - when it comes to color, makes me want to go back to a mid 80s barbie dream house.\\n    - difficult to use!.\\n    - i can tell when someone else is using it because i can smell it through the door and down the hall!\\n    - this kit is good quality, easy to use and clean.\\n    - just apply once a day in the morning and you dont have to worry about dryness or exessive oil throughout the day.\\n    - happened to me, had to get a new tank stand because it soaked the stand and ruined the particle board.\\n    - it will warm up and also work like a mild curling iron not quite made for use with a blow dryer, needs to be a metal shell so that when the blow dryer heat hits it, it will warm up and also work like a mild curling iron.\\n    - but i do use it between application of other deodorants to freshen up if needed.\\n    - five stars very nice piece, used it in my wedding and it was wonderful\\n    - she didnt even try to open the doors and i dont think she could have forced them open if she wanted to once they had the extra security in place.i occasionally board a 100lb rottie/pit mix, he may be able to break free even with the clips if he wanted to but it seems like it would hold most pups, especially with the doors extra secured.crate seems well made, was easy to assemble, and although its very large, it folds up relatively compact, small enough to easily fit under a bed or in a closet.i think this will meet my needs for most of the dogs i will board and the price compared to a major pet store, is pretty unbeatable!so far so good, but i will update if there are any issues with further use.\\n    - i broke out like crazy in the areas i used this.\\n    - let me tell you, they put the lies in supplies alright  the packaging looked funny to me, so i compared it to the blackout that i already have and the whole thing is a joke.<br /><br />it literally says this on the side of the packaging <br />the ultra charm conductor, illuminates the bee to direct the butterfly highly ingeniously utilizes the static electricity principle, lets the eyelash bythe natural sea and the plant essence cation spread the wings to fly presents the unprecedented volume to curl upwards, the eyelash slender favor, thickly glistens the growth increasea dense and the protection eyelash effect extremely good, the quality of material lithe exquisite eyelash pomade, temprately lastingly maintains you to be perfect accommodates, during contains the rich cellulose, can mold the slender effect.\\n    -

especially since the bird creates a ton of its own dust.we are very familiar with the arm & hammer baking soda brand so we were eager to try this product because it also contains arm & hammer baking soda.\\n    -

eh  this is the only cologne ive ever owned that has given me a headache..and ive owned several different colognes before.<br />i received this one as a gift<br /><br />i currently own<br />abercrombie fierce<br />d&g light blue<br />jean paul<br />fahrenheit dior<br />fuel for life diesel<br />versace eau de toilette<br />and<br />d&g pour homme<br /><br />of these, fierce, diesel, and jeal paul receive the most compliments<br />i dont know what it is, perhaps its just with me, but the smell of this cologe gave me a pretty bad headache because the smell is kind of piercing and stingy <br />overall, it smells mediocre.\\n    - this is by far the best pedometer ive ever used.\\n    - i started buying this detergent on amazon because my local whole foods stopped carrying it.\\n    - daily basis after washing your face.<br />because this item not sticky, i can also be used in summer.<br />i also like the smell.\\n    -

terrible product, do not use!\\n    - i used this on her twice a week right in the beginning and left it on her coat for 15 minutes like it says to do.\\n    - please dont use them if you received them for free or if you paid for them.\\n    -

it still works, but it got left in a house being remodeled it was out of the box and got super filthy, and i wanted to treat myself to a new one.\\n    - i have had one for 8 years, used it every day - this one does not heat like one & did not have the farouk seal.\\n    - it is definitely designed for a lady but even so it is bulky feeling and takes getting use to but it only feels that way the first time you put it on.\\n    - within 3 days of use my dark circles were completely gone.\\n    - it is exactly the same product as they sell here.but i have to say that when i opened the package, i was hesitant to put the flimsy guard in my mouth at night because i was afraid i might choke.\\n    - could eat on a higher surface that way my dog cant get to it.it took him a little while to adjust to it but only because of his disorder not the product, but now he loves it and sleeps in it instead of our bed, score!\\n    - furthermore, this collar is great because it has an audible beep warning, a vibration warning and a negative stimulation warning.\\n    - when i went to physical therapy for the first knee injury, my pt used this and i inquired if they were available to the non-medical public.\\n    - while it has many of the same features and attachments of other hair dryers it does offer salon style performance.<br /><br />notes-<br /><br /> - heats up very quickly<br /> - long cord - probably 8-10 feet which allows you a little freedom from your outlet<br /> - 3 speeds and three heat settings<br /> - the back screen lifts up so that you can clean the dryer motor<br /> - it is a bit heavy, which is the reason for removing one star<br /> - nice look to the dryer - it certainly does not look or feel cheap<br /> - three attachments including a diffuser and two concentrators<br /> - 1875 watts watch to make sure you do not trip your circuit breaker<br /><br />final verdict - this is a well-built machine that will likely last you for many years.\\n    - my wife and i both use this for relaxation and sleep.\\n    - sizes run extremely small which is a big disappointment because the quality of the shirt is great.\\n    - the closing mechanism is awkward at first but you get used to it quickly and can put it up in seconds.\\n    - i removed the bars the foot straps attach to because she hated the foot straps, we bought her boots to protect her feet.\\n    - i used this before and it worked fine, somethings changed my cat has started to get lumps of matted fur.\\n    - i have one cat and use arm & hammer clumping cat litter in my littermaid.\\n    - so please remember to keep some water handy because you will need it.\\n    - we used it on three different kinds of fur and it was very effective.\\n    - just used them on my lab for my first diy doggie mani-pedi ever and they work great!\\n    - what i got when i opened the box was a flimsy, rough shoe, stuffed with polyethylene foam sheets, and covered in recycled polyethylene--that cheap stuff they use to make those $1 green shopping bags that break after two grocery store trips, which costs about $0.03/ft.\\n    - because of the ware flying saucer 6-1/2-inch, medium and super pet hamster silent spinner 6-1/2-inch regular exercise wheel, color red-white.\\n    - i would say only three blackheads came out with this product and it hurts if i use it on a fresh pimple.\\n    - i get so may compliments hours after i apply this lotion!\\n    - junk this is a $160 flat iron supposedly the first day i used it the heat indicator light flashed to green when it was ready to go.\\n    - the good thing is because she has left the nubs, they are not a choke hazard so she can keep working on them.\\n    - a little larger than i anticipated for use on a cat.\\n    - i used q -tip and applied 1-2 drops of oil to my tooth and surrounding area and lo!\\n    - we did not install the wheels because we have no use for them.\\n    - ive actually never seen my dog remove a treat, but i know she is since i have to replace the treat every day or so.ive had it for about two weeks and its not showing any signs of wear and tear, and let me assure you i have a destructive little chewer in my house.\\n    - the velcro seemed of okay quality and we used it to secure the perch to our bedroom window.\\n    - i use 3 pumps on towel-dried hair then let air-dry for about 10 mins.\\n    - broke within an hour or using i got this tool, used it 1 time, and it broke right when i was done.\\n    - but it is not for face use.\\n    - after having used braun shavers since their first model, and a couple of others, i find this series 7 to be by far the best.\\n    - also, when you put these elastic straps it puts a lot of pressure on the neck opening making it really tight for the dog.anyway, i guess i can make my dog use it when it is pouring or some other extreme case but over all i am not thrilled with this purchase.\\n    - i use this a lot for my dh.\\n    - its an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use its an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use i like it very much and gonna be my best product\\n    - the only tissues i use!.\\n    - used in home dog soap recipe and have found room freshening use for it, as well.\\n    - her flaky scalp was gone within a few uses of this shampoo, and after a few months we stopped it and went back to her normal shampoo, and the problem never came back.<br /><br />fast-forward two years, and i developed weird crusty, flaking scales on my scalp, which my doctor described as psoriatic dryness, although she didnt full-on diagnose it as psoriasis.\\n    - ive used it once and already my scalp feels relieved.\\n    - no five star because i prefer the m-80 and assault.\\n    - i promptly ordered 4 more bottles so i would have it on hand if another incident occurred.about a week later i used it again but this time it seemed to have little effect.\\n    - nutramedix, the manufacturer, claims that there is research supporting its use as an antiviral against hh6 and ebv.\\n    - while theyre a fun addition, i dont think theyd be practical to use.\\n    - i bought this for my father to use on his arthritic knee and he says that some days it appears to really help.\\n    - the first time i used it my hair got caught in the slit and it took some hair with but as i got use to watching and making sure my hair didnt go past the point where the handle and the barrel connect i perfected it and now i love the way my hair looks after i finish it.\\n    - i have used this product for a couple of years now and it just about melts away the cuticle.\\n    - zadro mirror nice two sided mirror one side is  regular and one side  mag for applying makeup, distortion free glass, attractive, sturdy  pedestal base.\\n    - used it for years and love this product used it for years and love this product!\\n    - i was a little disappointed with the picture amazon had which has been replaced since i ordered.the original purchase and picture showed a package of 25 oinkers and more oz per pack.i would have still ordered it but feel somewhat mislead because i thought i was getting what was in the picture.oh well my dogs love them.the current picture is what i received\\n    - very useful!\\n    - not as advertised i purchased & then returned this product sold by toysngamesetc because what they are selling/shipping is not the product that is advertised on amazon.\\n    - love purpose soap have used purpose soap for the past 15 years.\\n    - my mom bought me some of this, because she knows i like natural products.\\n    - i guess it only works on certain hair types, because it certainly didnt work on mine.\\n    - you will need some practice of holding it correctly when you will first start to use this product.<br /><br />initially when i started using this i had some trouble in using it.\\n    - be sure to wash your face before and after use this thing.\\n    - the only brand my husband will use!\\n    - i used them for eating utensils for a wedding reception.\\n    - with my wavy hair, i couldnt really tell that it was doing much, but on the second day of use i decided to straighten my hair.\\n    - maybe its one of those genetic things like cilantro tasting like soap to some people but this is the first mouthwash ive used that makes me want to use another mouthwash to get the taste out of my mouth.\\n    - i have very small hands and i can use them with no problem and they dont slip.\\n    - i use them without fabric softeners or any oil and it feels and smells like i did but i also use a tide and that already has a sent.\\n    - this thing gets the job done better on my back than my ex-boyfriend who use to give massages all the time.\\n    - this would be due to one of two reasons, which i will get to shortly.its surprising because something like this is so simple to set up.opening the box, i noted that one of the thicker washers was missing, but it didnt matter to me because i wasnt going to use the water restricter.instructions were good and i soon had the unit set up.\\n    - i ordered this product because i trust olay products and needed a facial moisturizer with an spf which this one has.\\n    - yes, it dries your hair and makes it feel squeaky squeaky clean, but to remedy this i just used my usual awesome conditioner with it aubrey organics island naturals conditioner, not the conditioner that comes with this shampoo--it doesnt leave my hair soft and moisturized enough.\\n    - i wear mine under makeup and it doesnt interfere with any of the makeup application at all.\\n    - i have very fine, thin hair and i use have used this matrix root lifter for about a year.\\n    - except for a brief but very short learning curve, this new device is definitely easier to use and, based on comparison testing, every bit as accurate as our older cuff model.\\n    - i will be ordering one for every sink in my house!\\n    - apparently they contracted midget cats for their item photo.i mean, either the picture on the front of the box is photoshopped, or--and this is more likely, based on the fact that the shoe in the picture is made of something entirely different than the shoe in the box--they created a cat shoe playhouse that was actually worth $16.99 for the picture on the front of the box, then put this $1 piece of crap in the box and sold it to me.that makes me sad.\\n    - my daughter uses the razor attachment, while i use the epilator attachment.\\n    - easy to use and they work wonderfully.\\n    - the slant shape on a normal tub doesnt work for this and if you use it on the side it doesnt reach your back etc.\\n    - its cause maybe by some air get in but how .??\\n    - i have used this extensively for months now and the tweezers are still working well.\\n    - of continuous use\\n    - my cat had a first taste of it and it was ok. then she started having diarrhea and feeling miserable because she felt not clean all the time.\\n    - id recommend these if you use this size battery, you wont be disappointed.\\n    - we used it the very next morning!\\n    - i still like this one, and will continue to use it.\\n    - the only down side is that i have to use so many and its inconvenient, but its to be expected for something thats 36x18.\\n    - for a replacement you can use the canned air that you find at staples.\\n    - something i prefer not to use and am disappointed.\\n    - maybe its because i have a very tiny car, but its kind of annoying.\\n    - eventually they will just get used to it, so you should only use it a little bit at a time.\\n    - i really like it for what i use it for - brief work needing two hands on items close to my face, such as threading a needle, detail work on craft items, removing a splinter from my finger, etc.\\n    - i like putting it on my hands just before bed but its non-<br />greasy enough to use anytime.\\n    - its a little too tight around the eyes, but ill use it til it fits right.\\n    - the pump on it died after 2 years of 24/7 use, i got a replacement, but the replacement died after 2 weeks of use.\\n    - im only using at the ocean because i wanted my dog to learn to swim in the pool and she has.\\n    - well i would say yea, but not much and thats because i wasnt taking it to loose weight, but to balance my diet.\\n    - ive used hair colors for years on both myself, other people even mens goatees and ive never had color fade so fast.\\n    - best product ive ever used!\\n    - i have used a lot of different creams and beauty products as well as take beauty vitamins that beautify the skin from the inside/out.\\n    - great for sensitive legs i hate shaving because i often get bumps after wards.\\n    - use the night before i used to have to wash my hair everyday because it is so oily.\\n    - silk elements fx poshy purple i used the fx poshy purple!!\\n    - i just put her in a few times and walked around the house until she got used to it.\\n    - i bought this because my eye doctor suggested it.\\n    - the wax is a bit dry me hard to use.\\n    - i used amazon reviews to decide to purchase this item.\\n    - i will continue to use it until it is empty and  update my review at that time.\\n    - i have been practicing over the last couple of weeks and everybody can’t stop raving about my hair.<br />it is different than any other curler that i have used before, but i found it really easy to use and i am so thrilled with the results.<br /><br />if you are looking for an easy to use, safe and effective curling iron than don’t hesitate, this is an amazing product.\\n    - we used this bed for our dog in an effort to have him sleeping on the floor in his old age.\\n\\n- intent: verify_authenticity\\n  examples: |\\n    - real bb cream us versions cannot hold a candle to this brand.\\n    - it really works!.\\n    - excellent brush excellent brush, but the remote monitor is excessive  you dont really need it and it does not add much.\\n    - this works really well combined with my remote call and a decoy.\\n    - ive honestly never considered counterfeiting until i read some reviews here, but i checked out my package from this purchase, and it checked out.\\n    - i bought it in the oil free nude color, and really like what it has to offer for my face.\\n    - i dont know how much i can say, but the basics are that this smells really good and goes on smooth.\\n    - it kept getting caught and couldnt really do an effective job of cutting hair on the neck or back of the head.\\n    - i really am happy with gc and will continue taking it until i am at a happy place with my body.\\n    - but they look super awesome and they arrive fast and with some fake   you can only use them a couple of times before they stop opening and closing but they look super awesome and they arrive fast and with some fake cash.\\n    - i really like the 2 braces so i could wear them during the day and at night.\\n    - tell you it was free for a reason.made in a very cheap manner.doesnt really do its job.way to flexible to actually massagemost of these things have the arms to be not very flexible so it can use pressure around your head to actually feel something.there was dry glue all over the handle so it made my hand feel very uncomfortable when using.if this still goes for free i dont even think its worth you wasting your time on it.if i could give it zero stars i would but it wont let me.hope this review helped.cheers!\\n    - this stuff really works great - expensive but definately worth it.\\n    - this works really well to bring out the curls in naturally wavy hair.\\n    - cheat, easy to use and really works.\\n    - that was the only real problem i had with putting this together.\\n    - please point me at the authentic product, the real thing is no sham.\\n    - please do not buy this for a real fish.\\n    - i am 64 and i take care of my 7 month old very active grandson and this tongkat ali is just amazing for it really serve its purp.\\n    - i instantly looks like you have a tan and it looks real.\\n    - i really like it, i also have sensitive teeth and this is perfect for them.\\n    - plus, there are 10 pregnancy test strips which are really nice to have on hand without spending a fortune at the pharmacy!\\n    - when pulling it along the ground, it also rolls around a little sadly--much less realistic than the original.\\n    - this really helps me a lot in order to get less sick.\\n    - this stuff really works!\\n    - this stuff really keeps away the rodents, which i feed elsewhere in the yard now, and still they dont go near the feeders!\\n    - i really and truly love this hair i purchase it a few months back   ,i really and truly love this hair i purchase it a few months back and im still wearing it it does not get tangled and it looks so awesome on me\\n    - my three cats are really hard to please.\\n    - it really does grip and lift nicely, and the silver colored backing, below which the pins are set protects the hair shafts from potential damage nicely.\\n    - it smells really awfull.\\n    - its in small type, but i made the mistake of ordering this as part of a gift and didnt realize that its not returnable to amazon.\\n    - seems like a really nice product !.\\n    - i have been practicing over the last couple of weeks and everybody can’t stop raving about my hair.<br />it is different than any other curler that i have used before, but i found it really easy to use and i am so thrilled with the results.<br /><br />if you are looking for an easy to use, safe and effective curling iron than don’t hesitate, this is an amazing product.\\n    - an exercise in temporal incongruity.i let the cats torture the furminator so they feel comfortable.they claim not to like it, but cats lie.they do tolerate it, and by using it every couple of days, ive reduced the stray cat hair factor considerable.and the really long-hair cat doesnt mat any more.the furminator is an essential tool for preserving cat dignity.\\n    - these are either fakes, or the product is simply garbage now.\\n    - it was a really different experience, more gentle and soft.\\n    - not genuine gillette - even when sold direct by amazon i have been using mach3 cartridges for 10 years plus.\\n    - smaller than expected and really generic.\\n    - it really does work exactly as it   i started using defining gel and absolutely love it!\\n    - it sounds really great, if it worked & if i had instructions   i received mine & the colors dont work at all.\\n    - i would have given the item fewer stars, but i must say our little dog did really enjoy playing with it while it lasted.\\n    - i have told all my friends who have kids in diapers to buy a jar and a tube of grandma els diaper rash remedy and prevention.the jar on the changing table, the tube in the diaper bag.another great thing is that you use so little to cover babys diaper area, that the jar and tube last a really long time.which makes it so economical!\\n    - sprout supplements i have tried but would really like a chewable version.\\n    - the bracket really should be stainless steel, like the buckles on top of the harness.\\n    - maybe controlled the bad breath but as far as tarter goes, it never really removed it.\\n    - everything else seems to be ok so far but not really thrilled with the looks.\\n    - on the really positive side, though, i really like the way the waste bags are loaded and dispense - i havent found another all-in-one leash that has such a design.\\n    - i noticed a real difference after just one use.\\n    - the only plus side i have for these clip ins is that theyre soft and they dont really shed.\\n    - really removes dead hair from the dogs coat.\\n    - the color really stands out, even when its dark i can see him out in the yard, and its very heavy duty.\\n    - i really dont know what else to say about this product other than the fact that the price on amazon beats the price for the same product anywhere else that i have seen.\\n    - they taste really good, and since i look forward to them it helps me remember to take them every day.\\n    - these are really, really easy to install and only took about 20 mins each which was 95% for cutting the holes.\\n    - it is a really great deal.\\n    - i dont really like that it doesnt say how many probiotic cells you are getting per serving.\\n    - it feels good.<br /><br /> another thing i noticed, isnt really something you should   i am just clumsy in all that i do.\\n    - the reason i give it four stars are for two reasons, and they really are not big issues, firstly, the padded halter is easy to adjust but is like two inches to short.\\n    - it really does relieve the itch most of the time.\\n    - i like the grip of the extras, but they really hurt.\\n    - however, i will continue to use my loreal-voluminous non-water-proof formula for daily use and use the water-proof formula for situations that i feel call for it.\\n    - i must admit that i was a bit hesitant after reading reports of some digestive trouble  molly has historically had a sensitive stomach, and i didnt want to cause her a whole new bit of trouble.but, im happy to say that shes responded really well to duralactin.\\n    - it was such a good review - and it sounded real - that i decided to try it.\\n    - at first he walked funny which was expected, but after we took him out in the snow with them on a couple of times, then took him out without them on, he realized what they were good for.\\n    - the flights of stairs climbed reported can be drastically wrong from reality i heard they were working on a fix for this.\\n    - i could practically hear her saying, really?\\n    - well, you really need to try it for four months!\\n    - they are really like real nail polish when on, but s easy and fast to apply.\\n    - really nice lotion!\\n    - i really wish this had velcro to attach to pants or a backpack.\\n    - i used with a caffeine firming scrub when shower then follow with a collagen body cream  i really like the after effect feeling after i massage cream in.\\n    - i exercise my border collie, kibo, in the nearby woods, and with the start of hunting season, i had some real safety concerns to deal with.\\n    - which is to say, it works really, really well.\\n    - i have to color the part of my real hair that is left out to make it match the weave.\\n    - not sure if its really helped with my restless legs which is what it was recommended to me for but it does make my tired legs feel so much better.\\n    - so it really isnt such a bad thing.\\n    - im going to contact the manufacturer, and i really hate having to go through so much hassle , but for what i spent on this thing, i feel obligated to.\\n    - i like it and dont love it because its still not really quiet, the handle vibrates, and it currently costs about $25 more than the classic 76. that said, i do recommend giving these a look.\\n    - it made my hair so soft, like silk, really it is so soft, that i cannot believe it.\\n    - fortunately, i was reading up on it and found out tea tree oil can be really toxic for your dogs however, ive also read it can be very good for your dogs; but i dont want to chance it when there are other things i can use; and my dogs are tiny -- 8 and 10 pounds, so i didnt want to kill them or make them severely ill.\\n    - can you smell me great, i love the way that i smell every time i smell me   really scratch the screen and smell me .\\n    - fits really well.\\n    - make sure to get it really rubbed in well, because it could be streaky.\\n    - i now buy loreal, which is a much nicer formula.\\n    - i couldnt really carry her she is 55 lbs.\\n    - really does work!\\n    - she is either not as smart as i thought, or crafty enough to realize she neednt do any work when i will do it for her.\\n    - i am fortunate to have really great prescription drug benefits, but deplin -- since it is not considered a drug but rather a medical food -- is not covered.\\n    - really, its a fantastic tinted moisturizer not that ive tried many though.\\n    - this one not even 2 hours, ive had better body sprays that last longer and are closer to the real thing.\\n    - but i used the soap and really like it.\\n    - no real issues.\\n    - yep sounds really crazy.but it really works.\\n    -

the only negative i would say is that the little rabbits have a really loud squeaker inside them.\\n    - i found that the only way to really get it down to their skin really well was to use some electric clippers to shave a small spot on the back of the shoulders/neck area.\\n    -

cable comes with lots of kinks from the packaging, so its hard to get it into the right position in the tank, will have to track down a real suction cup.the device itself drifts up and down a bit, but it does say +/- 1 deg c accuracy.\\n    - i basically tried every cat food on the market, and started eliminating ingredients, until one day, i realized that peach may have the same allergy as i  an allergy to fish and seafood!\\n    - very realistic, dimensions are accurate, fun!\\n    - ive never used a deep tissue massage foam roller prior to receiving this product and wasnt really sure what i was in for.\\n    - really there’s no limit, as it’s a very versatile flavor.i also love that this product is made in the usa and comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee, so you can buy with confidence.\\n    - was really helpful as a framework over our fixed commode.\\n    - i havent really noticed any changes to my body yet but i am definitely going to keep using this product.\\n    - weve gotten to love our puppy but i didnt think i could live with that smell, plus it was really embarrassing when we had guests trying to mask the smell with air freshener and sprays.\\n    - really like this diffuser.\\n    - not authentic i was excited when i saw amazon had this in stock and was selling it from them directly as pure malt is not easy to come by these days.\\n    - great volume i really like this shampoo.\\n    - i bought this for my father to use on his arthritic knee and he says that some days it appears to really help.\\n    - this doesnt really work cause the the fabric is too thick and doesnt touch half the surface of my back.\\n    - only problem is that it doesnt stay on my face very long other than that, i really recommend this product!\\n    - its probably not as bad as i think it is, but it doesnt leave me with a clean feeling after i apply it which really bothers me.\\n    - really nice ice pack.\\n    - i realized that everyone responds differently, however, for me it was not good.\\n    - it really doesnt come off as being gray at all.\\n    - ive been spraying all pets twice a day with this stuff and soaking their bedding and favorite spots with it as well and it really seems to work!\\n    -

shes a real puller and the securely sewn-in harness held perfectly.\\n    - to achieve this, we need products that use post consumer paper waste.no, not as soft as kleenex, but does it really matter?\\n    - really tiny and exactly what i needed!\\n    - this water bottle has made it very easy for me to work this habit into my lifestyle!the only negative thing i would have to say about it, is that the opening really should be a little larger.\\n    - really really like it.\\n    - i realized i paid too much for this item, even it was on a special.\\n    - and the color of the milk is really darker than anthers!\\n    - wish they came in a version that held a few more ounces, but these are real briefs, not disposable ones.\\n    - this is nice because it really create a hammock as its name details which i feel is a great safety feature - short of actualy buying a seatbelt thing, but she likes to have her head out of the window too much for me to do that to her.\\n    - not for the real cleaning day, but in between.\\n    - this is a really nice scale.\\n    - but i saw real differences in two weeks.\\n    - five stars really good for a reasonable price.\\n    - im really doing well and have evengraduated to riding a bike to work to help with continued weight loss.\\n    -

this stuff really works.\\n    - he cant get tangled, and the harness is really secure.\\n    - this is hysterical.really.do not turn polly on when children are around or at your front door on saturday mornings when sweet mormon young men ring the door buzzer.yikes!\\n    - i have used this for over a month now and am really happy with it.\\n    - fits my dog comfortably, with enough room so, if i want to keep her really warm when were in snow country in the mountains, i can dress her in the hurtta waterproof fleece overalls and add this outer overall like an overcoat.\\n    - i also really like the blue backlight for early mornings before im ready to turn the overhead light on.\\n    - we adopted two five year old female beagles and they could not jump up on the bed and these stairs really worked out great.\\n    -

girls this is a really good concealer i love it., u only have to use small amount to see the result., its smooth rish yet natural looking., it covers the under eye tiredness very well.. and i contour my face and nose with the darker shade.. and since u have to block stay a cream with powder i used it with the powder concealers and blushes, forgot the name but it would appear in recommendations and search its a 6 large circle palette same brand\\n    - breastmilk is so precious and to see even a drop go to waste is unacceptable.i am not a fan of plastic, however, after researching for months trying to figure out an better way to freeze my milk, i really couldnt find a better solution than the plastic bags.\\n    - medifast really works.\\n    - i think it really helps but its not perfect.\\n    - perfect if you want to fake a tan!\\n    - i dont understand why this formula is not available through the stores; however, i found ordering it by the case through amazon to be really convenient, with free fast delivery, and price slightly less per ounce than most of the formulas at the grocery store.\\n    - although not the same as a real straight razor works realy well constructed well easy to change blades.this is a great tool for keeping beard lines straight.\\n    - the pumping spray has really helped me to style my hair without too much goop.\\n    - my mini schnauzer mutt loved this ---really loved it--- except she managed to tear it half apart after two days.\\n    - subtle and beautiful this bare escentuals natural muse collection really enhances beauty without being obvious.\\n    -

my only issue was a couple of the colors i tried had one long strand on the ends of the brushes that had to be clipped off with scissors for a nice smooth line.. no big deal really!\\n    - i really enjoy using the furminator.\\n    - likey likey really good product.\\n    - fake 5 star reviews and is just a horrible diuretic weight loss pill.\\n    - i have lost half of my hair over the last few years, and didnt realize it was from inflammation.\\n    - but really he probably like not knowing what the ball is going to do on every bite.\\n    - it can be really difficult, however, to find a good spray/leave-in conditioner that both does the job of detangling and protecting long hair and doesnt weigh down fine hair.\\n    - this stuff really works, and i couldnt believe it .\\n    - he would continuously  realize that product had to be reapplied again in order for him not to bite his nails and he would tell me himself to reapply it again.\\n    - they are fake products and can harm you!.\\n    - the fake grass just traps the smell and makes it more putrid.\\n    - the schwartzkopf hair spray is supposed to be the best in the business, but the got2be freeze spray is probably the same thing its really good and strong, btw.\\n    -

the watch is not comfortable to wear when weight lifting, as itcan pinch the wrist and does not really leave room for gloves or wrist wraps.\\n    - think about it, if this is really that big of a life changing issue for you, see your doctor for proven, effective results.\\n    - it only took about 2 weeks to really notice a difference in her skin and the hair had started growing back in the bald spot.\\n    - its also really helped reduce cravings and i havent been getting chips out of the vending machines as i used to.\\n    -

this really helps cut down on the amount of hair that comes in the house.\\n    - i purchased this for my husband and he really loves .\\n    - i realllyy value the thought of the care of package while been shipped .i like the packaging n smell almost smells like the aloe cholesterol from lustresilk .an american brand hair product.\\n    -

i mix it with my moisturizer, and it absorbs really quickly.\\n    - looks like real food.\\n    - my real parrot/conure freddie loves polly!\\n    - nothing like cellular release to free your mind and body from emotional bagage for real !hoping this review brings peace,healing and beauty into your life   \\n    -

if youre looking for a real crack-stuffer, forget this weak dick.\\n    - like tonight lol, its now 2 30 am and i took my dose around 5 30 pm they really do work great!\\n    - it is kind of loud and you can really hear it in the background.\\n    - after putting together the cat tree, about 15 min-really easy once i understood the pictures 4 hrs later hes on the top tier sitting proud while looking over his domain.\\n    - luckily my 8 month old can still wear these in a size 2.they have this mesh thing that pulls the 2 away from the skin.which i really love because cleaning that 2 is a pain.\\n    - at the very beginning, my puppy was chewing or trying to eat the fake grass but not anymore.easy to clean, just rinse with running water.\\n    - it really is lovely.\\n    - the problem i have is that it smells like nag champa incense, which i dont really like.\\n    - i gave a bottle to my mother because she has really dry skin on her face, and shes seen a great deal of improvement.\\n    - the smell is pleasant, but not overpowering or really herby.\\n    - great stuff my wife suggested i try this as my eyes were getting really puffy.\\n    - review for shea butter i used the shea butter to make bath melts and it was really easy to use and was excellent in the bath melts.\\n    - i really wanted to get this product bc i love bright, vibrant colors i really wanted to get this product bc i love bright, vibrant colors.\\n    - i love the bronzer for contouring - while in the pan it looks like it has some sparkle, that doesnt really transfer to the face, so what you see on your cheeks is a matte bronzer which is easy to blend and simply perfect for getting that chiseled look i am fair skinned, so i cannot use this shade as an overall bronzer - i dont like that look anyways, so i have no issues with the darkness of the bronzer.\\n    - nonetheless, we hadnt really used the hodgepodge of natural remdies we had acquired over the years, in part because we didnt feel comfortable we were making the right choice for a given condition and we had no comprehensive source for looking things up.\\n    - this stuff tastes good and gives you a real boost.\\n    - we found out about the magic brush and we really liked them.\\n    - i havent really noticed much of a difference in my stretch marks.\\n    - and really over priced for such a small bottle  \\n    - the glove is alright, but when you are holding the hair on the wand while its curling, it does get realllly hot and your finger is slightly burned.\\n    - my dog really likes this brand only.thanks from lorraine\\n    - the stain stays for hours and is really quite flattering, but theres no moisturizing, so i would recommend applying a balm afterwards, preferably with spf.\\n    - we were also having feeding issues with him.getting him to eat the non-pebble higher protein diet required to stabilize his diabetes was challenging.fortunately, i read somewhere on the internet that if you follow the shot with a treat which seems logical now but with the stress of the situation had not occurred to us yet, they will have less anxiety about the shots and it will enable a positive association to form, making the whole process easier for all concerned.well, finding a protein treat that was enticing to him was a challenge until our local pet shop owner recommended real toppers pure wild salmon treats.\\n    - we have 3 cats and 3 dogs so this brush was really put to the test.\\n    - this loreal super blonde and the new loreal paris creme lightening kit   this loreal super blonde and the new loreal paris creme lightening kit only lighten to a certain point.\\n    - my dog william loved it ,and so did i it kept him busy for a good while.i would reccomend this pet toy highly, especialy if you have a really active puppy .\\n    - they are really good for her too.\\n    - also, there are many discussions here about fake perfumes.\\n    - i was really excited to try it, but when you spray it, it is very misty and there isnt much sunscreen to be applied--and the smell permeates the area--and its not a smell where you think, &34;that smells bad&34; its more of a smell where it smells toxic.\\n    - was in the back of the class and the teacher said someone smells real nice back here.\\n    - its natural and actually foams up really well.\\n    - this thing is a novelty at best, the set up is absurd i cant really notice much of a difference.for the same price you can get a kaloud lotus and it works a hundred times better.\\n    - i really like the greens and blues.\\n    - i do not really believe in the typing of hair 100 percent.\\n    - hey really did reduce the pain in my knees and feet after standing 14 hours for work.\\n    - a little difficult to put soap in but it is really good for exfoliating.\\n    - really - no cramps or stitches!\\n    - really helped.\\n    - my face is really smooth and it is brighter.\\n    - i would like to return it but since my 6 yr old daughter loves to collect stuffed dogs with collars and leashes, i figured id just give it to her and purchase another, realistic leash for walking a real dog.\\n    - he could not really stand up, but he could easily turn himself around, which is what my vet said airlines are looking for.\\n    - it is important to realize that both forms are equally equivalent in efficacy.\\n    - there is a very subtle fragrance -- pleasant, but not really noticeable i dont like strong fragrances, so this is good in my book.<br /><br />one thing to note is that when you close the lid, a little bit of lotion comes out of the top.\\n    - i dont really find it bothersome too much now.\\n    - looks and feels really cheap.\\n    - irritates my skin for some reason this product hurts my skin when i apply it to my face, and leaves it really dry and rough after using it  so i am now stuck with bunches of extra products  -\\n    - i really like the size of this item, but the vibration quit after the first use.\\n    - i was not sure about how it would really work for me but was in need and thought i would give this one a  try as i watched them work on various heads of hair.\\n    - at one point asked my doc if it really worked, said they were grand for teething babies and those with arthritis.\\n    - the bars also bend really easily, so now that hes been pushing on the inside of it, its even more difficult to get it set back up once he gets out.\\n    - it smells really nice but ultimately will not protect you against bed bugs.\\n    - i only have 3 days applying this product and i really like it!\\n    - i lie on it and it gives a really nice stretch to the erectors spinae and paraspinal muscles.i weigh about 180 lbs and am 6 feet tall.\\n    - great addition to the toy box.my wife loves it.im glad i stumbled across this really cool invention.its so cool im stocking up on batteries.\\n    - this is suck a great idea, i really wish theyd stay on longer.\\n    - was great while it worked  this product really does work.\\n    - im back to buying this leash now, and its inexpensive enough that it doesnt really bother me that its poor quality and has to be replaced every few months.\\n    - the finished results looks professional and it looks really nice on my mantel piece or on a shelf.\\n    - it feels really go to apply on my face and i like to warm it up with my hands before applying on my face.\\n    - of water, and i feel like this flavor is really hard for me to swallow.\\n    - works really the same as the lotion, just easier to apply to the feet.\\n    - works really great sunscreen, the smell is very, very nice i have never had a sunscreen smell so good and it goes on clean and really does the job  i will recommend it \\n    - the scent is not a plus like weakened ivory soap with a dash of cheap lemon scent added; but, at a very small fraction of the typical cost, its a real steal.\\n    - i also am a law enforcement officer i didnt really care if i sweat because i was in a uniform and outside all day, but now im in an office wearing shirts and polos and i couldnt stand the embarrassment of large sweat stains indoors .<br />after reading many of the reviews i decided to give it a try.\\n    - its also adjustable both the arm and the lanyard/collar, so it works really well for me.\\n    - it says color changing but allot of the time the lights are all different colors at the same time, it just looks like a light in the tank and nothing really cool.\\n    - but if you cant do that, this is at least a well made fake.\\n    - ive tried several variations of slimming belts and i thought, instead of velcro, zippers would work really well.\\n    - it is great to use to help relieve any muscle soreness that   really doesnt help break up cellulite pockets.\\n    - my only real complaint is it is very expensive.\\n    - i really wanted to like the fitbit surge, but i have to say that it is a huge waste of money.the watch itself is rather good looking ,but it does not have $250 worth of functionality.the notifications and bluetooth music control system is clunky, glitchy and really quite worthless.i wanted to love the hr functionality, however it is constantly losing signal once you really startto sweat.\\n    - i really like how clean the filter pads leave my water.\\n    - i really think this a waste of money.\\n    - i really think that this product is helping my cat who has been diagnosed with ibs.\\n    - this came really bent.\\n    - you really are alot better.\\n    - i have demoed other chairs, and i really don’t know if the claimed superiority is accurate.\\n    - i dont think the neck area, at least for her body type, is the important measurement when trying to decide on what size to order, since the harness isnt really designed to fit around the neck.\\n    - our cat really lets you know she wants to be fed her natural balance platefulls and complains when our dog gets fed first.\\n    - fake the bottle i received was not sealed.\\n    - its the most advanced for keeping moisture in your hair and i can really tell the difference.\\n    - really does work to hide your thinning hair.\\n    - i found my self going for the jasons most of the time, it tastes great and is really foamy.\\n    - it really does hurt, especially when i want to sit down.\\n    - for the person that wrote the first review, henna isnt supposed to make your hair a new color unless you are really gray.\\n    - i wanted it to groom maltese, but the blade sizes arent really what i need for a body trim i have found.\\n    - medifast really works!.\\n    - i dont work for any of these groups, i am not a professional oil person and i am getting nothing in exchange for posting the truth except for some fake products that are headed to the trash.\\n    - if i have really dirty laundry i may use seventh generation liquid which isnt as green as this.\\n    - fantastic shave mug im pretty new to de shaving and will confess i did not really understand the purpose of a shave mug or bowl.\\n    - add to this that its make of einkorn, the only non-hybridized wheat left on our planet that im aware of, anyway, and you get a really great tasting food thats extremely healthy.\\n    - it stays really clean and the water is fresh.\\n    - but, it doesnt really sound like a bad thing!\\n    - to see what this is really about and ensure you get unexpired products, go to [ ] and they are shipped directly from the it works warehouse with easy return/exchanges policies.\\n    - the cat realizes whats happening and runs for the bedroom.\\n    - finally i realized i had to take a sterner hand with my diet and ordered the supplies for a high protein liquid diet.\\n    - 18 grams of protein is really good.but.what a messy bar this is to eat!\\n    - it seems crazy, but this stuff really works!\\n    - i must have lost a few hundred bucks in heating / cooling on this thing no really.\\n    - really works!\\n    - it does whiten and i just love the toothpastle it foams up and the mothwash burns worser than really sorry about caps  any way anything!\\n    - the only real problem is there is never enough glue and application tips in it so i would recomend buying the refils that some people sell on amazon.\\n    - to make it perfect, you should really have more colors to chose from, dog lovers will jump on pretty colors for their beloved pets.\\n    - i fed them to my dog anyway and he got really sick.\\n    - also as an added bonus you really get a lot for your money\\n    - ive managed to bend in one somehow but overall theyre really sturdy.\\n    - really great.\\n    - unlike a paper towel, one of these hand towels is enough to really dry your hands and they are soft to the touch.\\n    - its ok. i really love the look, and they are kind of comfortable but i never expected so much padding in them.\\n    - i real like the energy i have gotten.\\n    -   dry skin its thick and lingers & smells really good i have dry skin its thick and lingers & smells really good\\n    - i recently bought it for my mother-in-law for mothers day and she really liked it so a winner!\\n    - after i got it i realized that on the package it says that not for dogs under 6 month old.\\n    - however, as far as whitening goes, i dont really think it works because as soon as you stop using the soap, your skin returns to its previous state.\\n    - i really cant stand when people give a one star review just because their cat turned up his nose to a toy or a bed, because that says nothing about the construction and quality of the item.\\n    - now, of course, real custom orthotics will cost much more, but they are truly a custom product.\\n    - this does not work well if you have really long hair.\\n    - and the price is really good.\\n    - cost more than internet googling prices but the pills are the real thing from a doctor.\\n    - my only real complaint is with the scent.\\n    - im sure most dr.s and scientists will tell you that you need to actually get real testosterone put back into your body some how.\\n    - really disspointed.\\n    - it might seem like an exaggeration, but it is really that bad.\\n    - good, but .. i bought this because my hair on top is getting really thin and losing quite a bit of hair every time i shampoo in the shower.<br />with this product, it seems like im losing less hair loss when shampooing, but it leaves my hair feeling quite coarse.\\n    - perfect little pet waterer - it really does the job .\\n    - the fabric started to wear because of the sun and became really weak and dry.\\n    - really bad texture!\\n    - these brushes are really nice.\\n    - just sized weird, bought for my 4 month old german shepherd and fits real snug.\\n    - i was really excited to receive this, but when .\\n    - one thing for sure, i really dont want to continue taking her to the vet and watch them keep her on antibiotics, steroids, and anti-fungal meds.\\n    - i had bought a similar product at petco that really seemed to help my 4 year old rottweiler.\\n    - its ok it doesnt really exfoliate which is what i was hoping for and the bristles are not long enough to really get the arch area and between the toes, but it still beats bending over and generally gets feet pretty clean.\\n    - it really does the job when it comes to detangling hair.\\n    - its really great for your hair too!!\\n    - this one has a few more red strands then my first, but matches the rest real well.\\n    - not sure if we like hubby seems to go through these quicker than he should, wondering how good they really are, this is the 3rd one we have ordered, might consider new razor\\n    - it also looks really cute on her, so it was exactly what i was looking for.\\n    - really high quality stuff.\\n    - even a shallow bowl, where my first one came from.if it rattles, and/or looks too much like a green toupee, get real moss, that is not packaged, and actually works to remove carbons and keep water much safer for your fish.check out amazon, as i am looking now for a few more to put in a non filtered, weekly changed, 2 gal aquarium with a heater, stones and a nice hiding place for ms. starlite.\\n    - we ordered this system in the spring and really love it.\\n    - i bought this with a green coffee bean extract.i tried just the garcina cambogia by itself at first and it did not seem to really help.\\n    - the matte finish looks great on this lighter, makes the colors on it really pop.\\n    - really nice for newbies, to move them off of &34;the can of goop&34; and on to a much better face feel traditional product.\\n    - great for the skin, a bit too aromatic ive read that barage oil is one of the best oils for facial skin and i was really excited about trying it, but as soon as i opened the bottle i found it the aroma of this particular oil to be too strong for me.\\n    - finally an item that really does what it says it .\\n    - gets really sticky and the warming sensation didnt really help increase the sensitivity\\n    - the packaging was all i liked about this product i was really interested in the product because i have never used an under eye gel.\\n    - i really liked the way the product looked when i received it.\\n    - this conditioner made my hair so soft i ask people to touch it  x this shampoo and condition from nexxus is amazing  let me first say i do not ordinarily buy shampoo that costs $15, i normally buy cheap shampoo and conditioner because after years and years of trying many shampoos and conditioners i never noticed a difference with anything i used really.\\n    - the few weeks before we had seen the dentist, my son, was giving me big fits about brushing his teeth and he would not sit still long enough for me to really clean them well.\\n    - doesnt massage, doesnt keep heat, doesnt really do anything that a tub of hot water couldnt do.\\n    - majestic pure - vitamin c serum - this serum really changed the entire way i do skin care majestic pure - vitamin c serum - this serum really changed the entire way i do skin care-  i completely gave up all drug store junk and went all natural -

somehow, i really dont want my hair smelling like a cheap candle but luckily it doesnt linger for too long.\\n    - i think its too steep here, but i drive right past a target on my way home from work so factoring in gas money doesnt really account for my situation.\\n    - using them, i have been able to see how much damage cheating on my low carb diet really does.\\n    - also, i dont really like the idea of using something once and throwing it out if theres an alternative.\\n    - my wife really wanted a nice pink , but this is more purple.\\n    - really.\\n    - didnt really notice any excessive heat from the coils.\\n    - also, i am told that the real super slim only come from overseas, like china or japan.\\n    -

i really enjoyed these honey oat bars but my favorite bars are the chocolate chip clif crunch bars.these pretty much taste like those without the extra goodness of the chocolate chips.\\n    - the plant looks like a fake plant, the thing looks plastic not like a terracotta pot but i expected that since the plants fake and the base is plastic, but it still beats the exposed nasty litter boxes of the past, or the huge ufo looking fully enclosed boxes my cats wouldn’t go near.\\n    - i i thought my cat would rip apart a mouse a day, but it seems to get really attached with two of them.good news  i have a lot of gifts for other cat owners friends.\\n    - that cleared up his food allergy that i realized he had after it had cleared up from the food.\\n    - after using the pads for a little while, my cat realized he could cover up the wet spot by pulling one of the corners over it, but he doesnt cover it 100% of the time.\\n    - they really work.\\n    - it really does work in stopping and preventing side cramps and stitches during exercise i like to run.\\n    - is this the real vet pack.\\n    - other than that i really like these\\n    - the items in this package looks nice, but are very small and the handcuffs are really flimsy.\\n    - not the real super slim.\\n    - its a really cool shape and the color and curves dont stick-out like a sore thumb against my homes décor.\\n    - i never wear a real foundation anymore, good coverage and if i need to i add some concealer.<br /><br />price is reasonable as well.\\n    -

the purple color is a gorgeous violet and really stands out.\\n    - these really work trust me, i can tell if he misses a dose.\\n    - i have been looking for a really good hand cream with broad spectrum spf.\\n    - if the product is of high quality and benefits are as reported, then the company should trust real reviews, good or bad!\\n    - didnt really work\\n    - we really like the fact there is no monthly fee to this system since we can program our numbers in it & also 911 if we choose.\\n    - really good makeup, bad packaging really awesome mineral makeup!!!\\n    - i give this item a 5 star rating because i really didnt think my cat would let me use it on her, but she loves it and the quality is really good.\\n    - a really good one.\\n    - it was really painful.\\n    - this really did work for my dogs problem.\\n    - it took her a few minutes to realize that she could walk in them, but she bounded through the snow joyfully and with no complaints about her paws being cold.\\n    -

i took off one star for the price, but its really perfect for my needs.\\n    - i really feel a lot better and will continue taking these as long as needed.\\n    - it really works as well as described and for the price you cant go wrong.\\n    - good to find some in the regular packaging until we find out what almay really did to their makeup products.\\n    - i really do not like a lot of extra ingredients in my supplements.\\n    - they really love it.\\n    - i realize theres a give and take with such an item, its just that each of the first four people i showed them too, were unable to read them without a magnifier i could, but just barely.\\n    - we take six, 3 times a day, and it really helps with that dragged out tired feeling.\\n    - i like the color, but it really needs openings for seatbelts.\\n    - it appears i got a lemon -- the price of unrealized vanity.\\n    - really quite beautiful and inexpensive.\\n    - they are very fake looking and hard to place in your tank so they float properly.\\n    - .im really glad i got this for her!\\n    - apply a light layer of talc or powder to really dry off your legs first.\\n    - houdini, had managed to push through and bend one of the bars and luckily her head is really tough and she was not hurt.\\n    - an added issue is that i work at night- so by the time i felt really tired the sun was coming up.\\n    - it looked darker on the email than in real life - too light for me - doesnt look like i have any lipstick on or very pale.\\n    - i dont think ill be buying it again as i really cant tell any difference from before i started using it.\\n    - really great numbers.\\n    - works great, but uses batteries really fast\\n    - fake - unreal - don&34;t buy!!!\\n    - we are really bothered by mosquitoes this year.\\n    - they are really easy to use and my dogs love them.\\n    - it gives a really deep vibration which is what you really need when you are someone who deals with stress/anxiety, health issues, injury, or even just trying to recover from a tough workout or a physically taxing day.\\n    - i really lve the color and size.\\n    - not very easy, but really fun!.\\n    - i remember the crazy growth and gains i got from that formula, it was really unbelivable.\\n    - these work really well.\\n    - its the real deal!!\\n    - i wasnt expecting much, but its really good.\\n    - i like the night-time diapers they really do hold alot more then daytime and i apprecaite not changing a soaking wet 18mos old!\\n    - you know the idea behind this stuff is that it has really nothing in it.\\n    - i did get a dirty mat with a non-slip bottom that really helped.\\n    - the bangs are really long a few inches past my chin but i can work with that.\\n    - i think i will have to try the ushios as i have read really good reviews on their color and par values.\\n    - , while some only two 2-3. i had one particularly gross ring that still to this day i cannot get clean in the machine and im not really sure why.i remember reading about a review where the person had a gem fall out.\\n    - i just tested this out for the first time in real-time conditions.\\n    - its thick, comfortable, and made with real quality.\\n    - one star really no need for this  mix baking soda with water.\\n    - seems to really help my dog\\n    - the whole family uses this and it has really helped keep us from getting sick as often as well as reduced the time we are sick.\\n    - also, when you put these elastic straps it puts a lot of pressure on the neck opening making it really tight for the dog.anyway, i guess i can make my dog use it when it is pouring or some other extreme case but over all i am not thrilled with this purchase.\\n    - i still use a stronger hair spray on my bangs bc there i really need the extra hold.\\n    - hmm honestly beyond the scent i didnt really like it.\\n    - this product has really helped to suppress my cravings, and in 4 months i have shed over 20 pounds.\\n    - i really like it.another thing i noticed, isnt really something you should   i am just clumsy in all that i do.\\n    - this really works well with my grandson in the pool with no accidents so far.\\n    - it really helps tightening my pores and improving my breakouts a lot.\\n    - i was having terrible acid reflux and was miserable for over a month until i realized it was the fish oil i was taking.\\n    - amazing top coat i never really understood the point of a top coat until i used seche vite - the reason being that my previous top coat polishes were worthless!\\n    - i could occasionally get one of them to bat it around and eat some treats out of it, but that really only accomplished her eating more treats than i would normally give her.\\n    - i bought the red and it really it very attractive.\\n    - really dont like it when amazon says five stars means i love .\\n    - this stuff rules, it makes you look nicely tan right after you get out of the bed..but not scary fake tan.\\n    - i really like this product.\\n    - we purchased another one through amazon because the cats really love it and we humans had come to depend on it.\\n    - there really is no smell, no dust and i havent yet noticed any tracking!\\n    - easy to remove, easy to clean, really adds comfort to a long drive.\\n    - youd never know it unless you read it because it is simply a chrome slider not an actual lever that you can easily see.once i move the slider, the water came out full force and all three shower head positions work perfectly.so as a recap, here are the pros and conspros- really nice attractive design.- works well.- hose is metal not plastic.- hose is extra long!\\n    - the divacup didnt really work for me/my anatomy.\\n    - i think it really helped my immune system get back on track.\\n    - this is honestly the first product that i can say it really does work.most times i eat 2 at a time because that is what seems to work best for me.\\n    - i really wanted to use it topically but its a deep brownish yellow like betadine and stains everything near it.\\n    - therefore amazons description is a little confusing.because i just started, i cant give a really good review on it.\\n    - my husband really likes these socks.\\n    - despite this i was still skeptical thinkingtr the real test will be to see how soon my scalp will start itching.\\n    - and then i realized it looked orange in sunlight or fluorescent light, neither of which i had been applying this under, nor looked in a mirror with.\\n    - i still have an occasional spot pimple here and there fine by me, compared to my constant deep rooted spot acne, but this has been the only product that has given me really significant results.\\n    - upon reflection i realize it wasnt nice to enter his safe space with this gunk.\\n    - i just recieved this product and was really excited to use it after reading all the great reviews.\\n    - maybe one day hell realize that he doesnt have to eat so fast that he sometimes chokes.\\n    - really great product i really like this product, does not leave the hair sticky and does what it says it does.\\n\\n\""
